# RLS (Row Level Security) Audit Report

## Executive Summary

This audit examined the Row Level Security policies across all tables in the Durability app's Supabase database. The analysis revealed significant gaps in RLS implementation that could pose security risks.

## Key Findings

### ✅ Tables with RLS Working Correctly (8 tables)
- `profiles` - Users can only access their own profile data
- `movement_blocks` - Properly secured
- `movement_block_items` - Properly secured  
- `sports` - Public read access, properly secured
- `equipment` - Public read access, properly secured
- `goals` - Public read access, properly secured
- `injuries` - Public read access, properly secured
- `body_parts` - Public read access, properly secured

### ⚠️ Tables That Need RLS Investigation (10 tables)
- `assessment_results` - RLS enabled but policies may be insufficient
- `assessments` - RLS enabled but policies may be insufficient
- `movements` - RLS enabled but policies may be insufficient
- `user_programs` - RLS enabled but policies may be insufficient
- `user_workouts` - RLS enabled but policies may be insufficient
- `user_workout_blocks` - RLS enabled but policies may be insufficient
- `user_block_items` - RLS enabled but policies may be insufficient
- `user_set_logs` - RLS enabled but policies may be insufficient
- `pattern_types` - RLS enabled but policies may be insufficient
- `movement_patterns` - RLS enabled but policies may be insufficient

### ❌ Critical Tables with RLS Issues (1 table)
- `programs` - **CRITICAL**: RLS not working properly, unauthenticated access allowed

## Security Risks Identified

1. **Data Exposure**: Users may be able to access other users' data
2. **Unauthorized Access**: Some tables allow access without proper authentication
3. **Inconsistent Security**: Different tables have different levels of security
4. **Missing Policies**: Many tables lack comprehensive RLS policies

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Apply RLS Migration**: Use the provided migration script `20250813_009_fix_rls_policies.sql`
2. **Test All Access Patterns**: Verify that users can only access their own data
3. **Monitor Access Logs**: Watch for any unauthorized access attempts

### Security Policy Framework

#### User Data Tables
- **Principle**: Users can only access their own data
- **Implementation**: Use `WHERE profile_id = auth.uid()` in all policies
- **Tables**: profiles, assessment_results, assessments, user_programs, user_workouts, user_workout_blocks, user_block_items, user_set_logs

#### Library Tables  
- **Principle**: Read-only for authenticated users
- **Implementation**: SELECT policies with `USING (true)` for authenticated users
- **Tables**: movements, movement_blocks, movement_block_items, programs

#### Public Reference Tables
- **Principle**: Readable by all users, no writes
- **Implementation**: SELECT policies with `USING (true)` for all users
- **Tables**: sports, equipment, goals, injuries, body_parts, pattern_types, movement_patterns

## Migration Script

A comprehensive migration script has been created at:
`supabase/migrations/20250813_009_fix_rls_policies.sql`

This script will:
- Enable RLS on all tables that need it
- Create appropriate policies for each table type
- Grant necessary permissions to authenticated users
- Create performance indexes for policy enforcement
- Verify RLS is enabled on all tables

## Testing Checklist

After applying the migration:

- [ ] Unauthenticated users cannot access user data tables
- [ ] Authenticated users can only access their own data
- [ ] Public reference tables are accessible to all users
- [ ] Library tables are readable by authenticated users
- [ ] Service role can bypass RLS when needed
- [ ] All CRUD operations work correctly for authenticated users
- [ ] Performance is acceptable with RLS policies

## Long-term Security Considerations

1. **Regular Audits**: Conduct RLS audits quarterly
2. **Policy Reviews**: Review policies when adding new tables
3. **Access Monitoring**: Implement logging for policy violations
4. **Testing**: Include RLS testing in CI/CD pipeline
5. **Documentation**: Maintain clear documentation of all policies

## Conclusion

The current RLS implementation has significant gaps that need immediate attention. The provided migration script will establish a comprehensive security framework that ensures:

- User data isolation
- Proper access controls
- Consistent security policies
- Performance optimization

Implementing these changes will significantly improve the security posture of the Durability application.
