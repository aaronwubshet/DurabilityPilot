can you review my iOS app
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 20s

Happy to—though “review my app” is vague. Since I don’t have your build, here’s a no‑BS teardown framework tailored to Durability (injury prevention/recovery + CV + HealthKit). Use it today against your current build. If any of these sting, good—that’s where the wins are.

10‑Minute First‑Run Audit (what I’d test immediately)

Cold start (TTI): Under 2s to first interactive screen. Over 4s = drop‑off risk.

Onboarding path: Can I reach a meaningful “Aha” in ≤60 seconds without creating an account? If you wall everything, you’re losing 20–40% of curious traffic.

Value proof before permissions: Do you ask for HealthKit, Camera, Notifications after you’ve shown why they matter (and preview my data), or up front out of fear?

Personalization: Are the first 3 inputs actually changing the plan I see (ACL vs Achilles vs shoulder), or just collecting trivia? If I toggle injury → plan actually changes in copy, exercise selection, volume, and progress gates.

Plan readability: Does the plan show today’s 3–5 tasks, time cost, and expected feeling (pain/effort)? Or just a vague “Week 1 Day 1”?

Camera flow: One tap from plan → assessment. No dead‑end modals, no camera permission ambiguity, no landscape lockups.

Exit ramps: If I’m not ready to film, can I still progress with a guided alt (no‑camera option)?

Paywall timing: Is there a premature wall before any tracked win? You should let me complete one micro‑assessment or one day’s plan before charging.

Account creation: Apple Sign‑In works, returns correct email scope, and re‑auth is seamless across reinstalls.

Error states: Turn off Wi‑Fi and deny HealthKit/Camera. Do you degrade gracefully, or just throw a spinner?

Product Holes I Expect (prove me wrong)

Generic plans in disguise. If 80% of the plan text is the same regardless of injury, you’re shipping placebo personalization. Make triage questions deterministic (surgery status, graft type, pain triggers, return‑to‑sport timeline) and visibly change the program.

Assessment theater. If the motion “assessment” doesn’t change loading parameters, exercise selection, or session pass/fail thresholds, it’s a gimmick. Tie metrics to progress gates.

No post‑PT confidence loop. “You’re cleared!” isn’t a plan. Show me confidence scoring, weekly risk score, and a visible runway to return‑to‑play (RTP) milestones.

Overreliance on mobility. ACL and Achilles rehabs are load‑progression problems. If your library leans 70% toward mobility/band work, you’ll lose serious athletes.

Paywall shape. $40/mo with fuzzy value copy and no concrete outcomes (“reduce re‑injury risk by X%”) will under‑convert. Price is fine; proof isn’t.

UX & Copy (tighten or cut)

Promise > feature list. “Personalized recovery” is a commodity phrase. Show one tangible promise above the fold: “3x/week, 20 minutes, return‑to‑run in 6 weeks if you pass these gates.”

Session anatomy: Each day should show: objective (why today), time, equipment, pass criteria, and a single CTA. If you have more than one primary button, you’re off.

Language for athletes: Kill “engage your glutes.” Use cues (“push the floor”, “knee tracks over mid‑foot”) and rep targets tied to symmetry/tempo.

Progress screen: Not streaks. Show strength symmetry %, rate‑of‑perceived stability, hop‑test delta, ROM

You said:
the app.zip file I have in the project has my iOS app
ChatGPT said:

I can’t see your archive. I checked /mnt/data and there’s no app.zip there—only a leftover app_extract/ folder from a failed attempt. So I can’t open the project yet.

If you want a real review (code + UX), do one of these now:

Upload the app.zip directly here.

Or share the Xcode project structure (screenshots of the file navigator + Info.plist), and paste the key Swift files: app entry, onboarding, HealthKit manager, camera/assessment flow, paywall, and any networking layer.

While you get that sorted, here’s what I’ll hit—ruthlessly:

Code audit (first pass)

App target hygiene: CFBundleIdentifier, versioning, build settings, SceneDelegate/@main setup, Swift Concurrency usage, dead frameworks.

Privacy keys: NSHealthShareUsageDescription, NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription, NSCameraUsageDescription, NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription, NSMotionUsageDescription. Missing any of these? Your permissions flows will face‑plant.

HealthKit: Are you reading only what you need? Are types split by read vs. write? Any force‑unwraps or try! around HKHealthStore.requestAuthorization?

Camera pipeline: AVFoundation session lifecycle, orientation handling, back‑pressure on the capture queue, and memory churn when transitioning in/out of the assessment view.

State management: If this is SwiftUI, are you overusing singletons/EnvironmentObject? Navigation driven by model state or ad‑hoc booleans?

Networking: Any blocking calls, missing timeouts, or “fire‑and‑forget” requests that can desync plan state.

Secrets: API keys/URLs hardcoded in Swift or Info.plist? I’ll flag them.

Error handling & offline: Are failure states user‑legible, and do you degrade gracefully with no network?

Product/UX audit (what I’ll be harsh on)

Onboarding → first win ≤60s: If I can’t complete one assessment or a tangible micro‑task before you ask for money, you’re leaking users.

Permissions after preview: Ask for HealthKit/Camera after showing why.

Program logic: If ACL vs. Achilles vs. shoulder plans look 80% identical, it’s placebo personalization.

Assessment that matters: Do metrics change loading, exercise choice, or pass/fail gates? If not, it’s theater.

Session anatomy: Each day needs objective, time cost, equipment, pass criteria, single primary CTA.

Progress that builds confidence: Symmetry %, hop‑test deltas, RTP milestones—not vanity streaks.

Paywall shape: Let me bank a win first; show concrete outcomes.

Upload the zip (or paste the key files) and I’ll tear through it. If you’d rather start with screenshots, send: onboarding, today view, assessment flow (pre‑permission and in‑session), progress screen, and the paywall.

ChatGPT said:
Thought for 13s

Still can’t see it. I checked /mnt/data again—app.zip isn’t there in this session. That means the archive didn’t land in this chat’s runtime (common when a file was uploaded in a different thread or the upload hiccuped).

If you want me to actually review the code today, do one of these now:

Option A — Re‑upload the archive here

Drag/drop app.zip directly into this chat. I’ll unpack and run a static audit immediately.

Option B — Paste the critical files (fast)

Paste the full text of these files (or re‑zip just these and upload):

App/*.swift that includes @main (App entry)

Onboarding flow (OnboardingView.swift / nav container)

HealthKit manager (HealthStore, authorization + reads/writes)

Camera/assessment module (AVFoundation or Vision flow)

Paywall/subscription manager (StoreKit 2 code)

Networking layer (API client, env config)

Info.plist for the app target

Option C — Run this on your Mac and paste the outputs

Terminal (in your project root):

bash
Copy
Edit
# 1) Tree snapshot
find . -maxdepth 3 -type d -name .git -prune -o -print | sed -n '1,200p'

# 2) Info.plist privacy keys
/usr/libexec/PlistBuddy -c "Print" **/Info.plist 2>/dev/null | \
egrep 'CFBundleIdentifier|CFBundleName|CFBundleShortVersionString|CFBundleVersion|NS(Health|Camera|Photo|Motion|Microphone|UserTracking).*Description' || true

# 3) Quick static smells
grep -R --line-number --include="*.swift" -E 'try!|!\s|URLSession\.shared\.dataTask\(|api(_|-)?key\s*[:=]\s*".{12,}"' . | sed -n '1,200p'

# 4) HealthKit & AVFoundation usage map
grep -R --line-number --include="*.swift" -E 'import (HealthKit|AVFoundation)|HKHealthStore|HKSampleType|AVCapture|VNDetect' . | sed -n '1,200p'


Paste those four outputs and I’ll rip through them.

While you’re getting me the files, here’s the bar I’ll hold you to (so you know what’s coming):

Permissions copy & sequencing: I’ll fail you if you ask for HealthKit/Camera before showing a preview of the value and the exact data you plan to use.

Plan logic: If changing “ACL vs Achilles vs Shoulder” doesn’t materially change exercise selection, loading, and gate criteria, I’ll call it placebo personalization.

Assessment → prescription: If your computer‑vision metrics don’t update the program (volume, intensity, or exercise swaps), it’s assessment theater.

StoreKit 2: I’ll check for proper Transaction verification, restore flow, and receipt handling; if you lock content after a successful transaction because model state didn’t update, I’ll flag it.

Crash landmines: any try!, force unwraps, or capture‑session lifecycle bugs during orientation changes.

Your move: re‑upload the zip here or dump the files/outputs above. Then I’ll do the detailed teardown.

Executive summary

You’ve got decent scaffolding (async/await everywhere, a clean “Services” layer, Supabase via SPM, NWPathMonitor, @MainActor use). But the product‑critical bits are either missing or stubbed:

No computer vision in the build. You record video via UIImagePickerController and stop there.

HealthKit writes are risky (you attempt to write stepCount/activeEnergyBurned instead of HKWorkout), which is an App Store review landmine.

Onboarding is bloated (OnboardingViewModel.swift is 821 lines) and asks for HealthKit first—exactly the wrong order for conversion.

Logging is noisy (≈170 print calls) and will pollute release builds.

Huge monolithic views (823/821/741‑line files) will slow you down and guarantee regressions.

What I found (facts, not vibes)

Project & deps

Xcode proj + SPM present. Package.resolved pins supabase-swift 2.31.2 and a few pointfree libs (Clocks/ConcurrencyExtras). No Composable Architecture.
File: Durability.xcodeproj/.../Package.resolved

Privacy / Info

You don’t keep a standalone Info.plist. Privacy strings live in the project.pbxproj (fine, but easy to botch in merges).

Present (with copy): NSCameraUsageDescription, NSMicrophoneUsageDescription, NSPhotoLibrary(Add)UsageDescription, NSHealthShareUsageDescription, NSHealthUpdateUsageDescription.
Missing (and probably OK): NSUserTrackingUsageDescription, NSMotionUsageDescription.
Source: Durability.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj

HealthKit

Read types: steps, active energy, heart rate, body mass, height, DOB, sex.
Source: Config.swift (lines ~36–44)

Write types: stepCount + activeEnergyBurned (bad idea).
Source: Config.swift (healthKitWriteTypes)

Authorization flow is async/await and correctly separated read/write.
Source: HealthKitService.swift

Camera / Assessment

Video capture uses UIImagePickerController with mediaTypes = ["public.movie"]. That’s a stopgap, not production capture for analysis (no control of FPS, orientation, stabilization, or bitrate).
Source: Views/Main/CameraView.swift

Assessment flow is UI‑only; no Vision/CoreML imports anywhere; results are mapped from IDs and static text.
Sources: AssessmentFlowView.swift, AssessmentResultsView.swift

Networking / Supabase

You use the Supabase SDK (not rolling your own URLSession), with a retry wrapper and typed selects/inserts. Good.
Sources: ProfileService.swift, PlanService.swift, AssessmentService.swift, NetworkService.swift

Supabase client is initialized via a singleton in AuthService.swift (odd place; workable).
Source: class SupabaseManager (inside AuthService.swift)

Config leaks: default Supabase URL and anon key are hardcoded in Config.swift. The anon key is meant to be public, but hardcoding still invites accidental environment drift and makes rotation/opsec sloppy.

App architecture

@MainActor used on services and app state (good).

AppState coordinates auth/onboarding/profile/assessment; fine for now, but it’s growing.

Huge files:

AssessmentResultsView.swift (823 lines)

OnboardingViewModel.swift (821 lines)

ProgressDashboardView.swift (741 lines)

ProfileView.swift (442 lines)

HealthKitService.swift (434 lines)

Diagnostics

~170 print(...) calls scattered across app, views, and services.
Example locations: AppState.swift, Assessment*View*.swift, HealthKitView.swift, etc.

App‑store‑risk red flags (fix before you submit again)

Writing steps / active energy to Health: switch to HKWorkout + attach samples if you must. Writing raw steps/energy from your app will look fraudulent.
Fix (high‑level):

Replace healthKitWriteTypes with:

swift
Copy
Edit
static let healthKitWriteTypes: Set<HKSampleType> = [
HKObjectType.workoutType()
]


When users log a session, write a workout with metadata and do not fabricate steps/energy.

Permission order & copy: You ask for HealthKit first (OnboardingStep.healthKit is step 0), before proving value. That hurts conversion and invites “Don’t Allow.”
Fix: Move HealthKit to the third screen, after you preview the plan/assessment and show a mock of what you’ll read and why.

Assessment capture: UIImagePickerController isn’t acceptable for reliable analysis. You need AVCaptureSession + AVCaptureVideoDataOutput with target 1080p @ 60fps (or your model’s expected input), locked orientation, and stabilization.
Fix: Replace CameraView.swift with an AVCapture‑backed controller; don’t save to Photos by default—write to your sandbox and upload.

Monolith files: You will drown in 800‑line view/view‑model files.
Fix: Split into subviews and smaller view models. Example: AssessmentResultsView → header, key metrics list, RTP milestones, next actions.

Logging: 170 prints is messy.
Fix: Create a small wrapper over Logger (or OSLog) with build‑config gating:

swift
Copy
Edit
import os.log
let log = Logger(subsystem: "ai.mydurability.app", category: "app")
#if DEBUG
log.debug("AppState: initializing")
#endif

Product gaps (you’re selling a story you haven’t earned yet)

No CV: You record video and return “results” from static maps. That will get noticed by users and reviewers. Ship at least one credible metric (e.g., knee‑valgus estimate, ROM proxy) even if it’s Model‑Lite (e.g., human‑pose via Vision + a couple of angles).

Personalization theater: Plans appear to key off IDs and generic mappings. If ACL vs. Achilles doesn’t materially change exercise selection, progression, and pass gates, your “personalized” claim is empty.

No paywall: There’s no StoreKit. If you intend to charge $40/mo, you need products, entitlements, restore flow, and entitlement gating. Right now it’s not there.

Concrete file‑level fixes (do these next)

Config/HealthKit

Durability/Durability/Config.swift

Remove stepCount/activeEnergyBurned from healthKitWriteTypes.

Add HKObjectType.workoutType().

Replace URL(string: ...)! with guarded init to avoid crashy config:

swift
Copy
Edit
static let supabaseURL: URL = {
guard let s = ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["SUPABASE_URL"],
let url = URL(string: s) else {
fatalError("Missing SUPABASE_URL")
}
return url
}()


Onboarding ordering

Views/Onboarding/OnboardingViewModel.swift

Change OnboardingStep order so .healthKit is not first. Add a “Why we need Health” screen that shows the exact data types you’ll read/write (steps, heart rate, etc.) before the prompt.

Split the 821‑line file into: OnboardingState, OnboardingActions, OnboardingScreens/….

Camera

Views/Main/CameraView.swift

Replace UIImagePickerController with an AVCaptureSession‑backed controller.

Force portrait, fix FPS, and enforce 1080p. Export to your sandbox and upload with StorageService. Offer an opt‑in toggle to also save to Photos; otherwise remove NSPhotoLibraryAddUsageDescription.

Assessment Results

Views/Assessment/AssessmentResultsView.swift (823 lines)

Extract subviews (ResultHeader, MetricCard, RiskBlock, NextStepCTA).

Stop mapping magic ints → strings; pipe real DB records or typed enums.

Logging

Sweep the repo and replace print with a Logger wrapper and disable in Release.

Auth / Supabase

Services/AuthService.swift

Move SupabaseManager to its own file.

Verify session refresh flow; right now I don’t see robust token refresh/observer calls.

Lock down RLS (server side, but your client code assumes it). Avoid any endpoints that rely on broad policies.

Error handling

HealthKitService.swift silently swallows many do/catch blocks. At least funnel them into a single errorMessage sink and surface actionable retry copy.

What’s good (don’t break it while you refactor)

Async/await everywhere, @MainActor on app‑wide services — solid.

Supabase typed queries with a central NetworkService and retry semantics — keep that.

NWPathMonitor for connectivity awareness — good base for graceful offline states.

7‑day hardening plan (aggressive but realistic)

Day 1–2: Split the 3 giant files; reorder onboarding; replace prints with Logger; remove HK writes to steps/energy; add HKWorkout writes (stub is fine).

Day 3–4: Replace UIImagePickerController with AVCaptureSession pipeline; standardize capture to 1080p@60; sandbox storage & upload.

Day 5: Implement a minimal one real assessment metric (e.g., hip‑knee‑ankle angle using Vision pose detection) and drive a visible prescription change.

Day 6: Add StoreKit 2 scaffolding (products, purchase, restore, entitlement check) — don’t gate hard yet, just prove the loop.

Day 7: Tighten HealthKit copy (list exact types), add a “Preview your dashboard” before requesting permissions, and run a fresh TestFlight pass.

If you want, I can generate patches for:

Config.swift (HK write types & URL safety),

a basic Logger.swift,

a skeleton AVCapture camera controller to replace CameraView.swift,

and a minimal HKWorkoutWriter.

Say the word and I’ll drop those in.

can you help me build an atomic movement library
ChatGPT said:

Good. Let’s stop hand‑waving and actually build it. I generated a practical starter kit for an Atomic Movement Library—schema, DB DDL, Swift models, seed movements, and CV mappings—so you can wire this into Durability immediately.

movement_schema.json — JSON Schema (atoms, metrics, cues, constraints, progressions, contraindications).

supabase_schema.sql — Postgres DDL tailored for Supabase (tables + basic RLS stubs).

swift_models.swift — Codable models matching the schema.

seed_movements.json — 12 seed movements (ACL/Achilles‑biased) with pass/fail rules.

cv_mapping.md — how each seed maps to concrete CV features & camera setup.

content_readme.md — usage, pitfalls, and next passes.

If you only do three things this week, do these:

Adopt the schema (or tweak, but don’t bikeshed forever). Load seed_movements.json on app start, cache it, and drive the UI from it. If an exercise, cue, or “metric” isn’t in the library, it doesn’t exist in the app.

Pick one measurable feature per pattern and make it real. For ACL, that’s knee valgus on step‑down. For Achilles, peak heel height or tempo‑compliant reps. If you can’t measure it on‑device with your current camera flow, the cue gets cut. No exceptions.

Gate progression with data, not vibes. The seed includes progression edges (e.g., Step‑Down → Split Squat to Box) with explicit thresholds. If the metric doesn’t pass, don’t progress. If the athlete reports pain >3/10 on a set, regress.

Blunt feedback on your request:

“Atomic library” isn’t just taxonomy; it’s execution rules. Most teams stop at tags and pretty names. I gave you metrics, thresholds, and camera constraints because without those your “atoms” are just labels.

You don’t have Vision/CoreML wired yet. Either integrate a simple pose estimator now or you’re running a fake assessment loop. The mapping file gives you a minimal path.

Keep the files small and versioned. When you inevitably change a threshold, bump the library version and snapshot to movement_versions. If you don’t, debugging athlete regressions becomes impossible.

Want me to extend this with shoulder/UCL and labrum (ER/IR @ 0°/90°, scaption, low‑row, wall slides, forearm pron/supination) and generate another seed pack? Or wire the Swift models into your current views so program cards pull from this instead of hard‑coded text?

Atomic Movement Library – Editable Template
Now interactive!

You’ve got the right ingredients, but it’s messy. Categories overlap, some “movements” aren’t movements (e.g., Rest), and your supermetrics are duplicative (range of motion vs flexibility vs mobility). Here’s a tighter system and an editable template you can use now.

What to fix (bluntly)

Nail the ontology. “Forward fold” and “Hip hinge” aren’t peers with “Deadlift”—one’s a pattern, the other’s a loaded variant. Decide: pattern vs exercise. Keep patterns clean (squat, hinge, push, pull, lunge/split, gait, brace, rotate, shoulder raise, etc.) and put variants (deadlift, bench press, overhead squat) under them.

Cut category bloat. Merge “range of motion / flexibility / mobility” → mobility (active, controllable ROM). Keep functional strength and aerobic capacity. Three supermetrics are enough to start.

Intensity is contextual. Strength uses reps/sets/load/tempo/RPE. Mobility uses hold time/angle. Aerobic uses time/distance/pace/RPE. Don’t try to make one schema fit all rows.

Impact scores need formulas. Don’t hand-wave “Recovery/Resilience/Results.” Tie them to measurable things (e.g., pass rate on form metrics, load tolerance progress, symptom gating).

Use this template

I generated an editable table for your list with sensible defaults (pattern, intensity schema, supermetrics). Open it, edit, and re‑import to your DB.

CSV: Download

JSON: Download

The columns:

movement_id (slug), movement_name, pattern (controlled vocab)

joints_impacted, muscles_impacted (semicolon‑separated)

supermetrics_impacted (choose from: functional_strength;mobility;aerobic_capacity)

sports_relevance (semicolon‑separated)

intensity_schema (pre‑filled per pattern; leave as a contract)

recovery_impact_score, resilience_impact_score, results_impact_score (leave blank until you define formulas)

video_demo_url, text_description

Suggested controlled vocab

Patterns: squat, hinge, lunge_split, push, pull, brace, rotation, shoulder_raise, gait, gait_run, flexion_spine, extension_spine

Supermetrics: functional_strength, mobility, aerobic_capacity

Intensity schemas:

Strength/power (squat/hinge/push/pull/shoulder_raise/lunge_split): {reps:int, sets:int, load:kg, tempo:str, rpe:0-10, side?:LR}

Mobility/positional (flexion_spine/extension_spine/hamstring_length): {holds:int, hold_time:s, angle?:deg, sets:int, rpe:0-10}

Aerobic (gait/gait_run): {duration:min, distance:km, pace:min_per_km, rpe:0-10}

Quick calls on your list (examples)

Squat / Overhead squat: pattern=squat; joints: ankle/knee/hip/shoulder/torso; supermetrics: functional_strength + mobility.

Deadlift / Hip hinge / Forward fold: pattern=hinge (forward fold is a mobility variant; don’t mix it with loaded hinge metrics).

Bench press / Push up / Shoulder raise: pattern=push or shoulder_raise (separate).

Lunge / Lunge and twist: pattern=lunge_split; add rotation atom only if you actually coach/tracks twist.

Walk/Jog/Run: pattern=gait (walk) / gait_run (jog/run), intensity via time/distance/pace.

Cobra / Child’s pose: extension_spine / flexion_spine with hold‑time intensity.

Active straight leg raise: hamstring_length (positional assessment/exercise).

Rest: Not a movement. Track as a session attribute (recovery_day) with zero intensity.

Make the impact scores real (minimum viable formulas)

Recovery Impact Score (0–100): inverse of symptom burden + compliance with deload/hold prescriptions.
= 60 * (1 - avg_pain/10) + 40 * (recovery_day_compliance%)

Resilience Impact Score (0–100): consistency × pass rate on form gates × progressive overload.
= 0.4*(week_sessions/target) + 0.3*(form_pass_rate) + 0.3*(progression_pass_rate) → scale to 100

Results Impact Score (0–100): change in primary KPI (e.g., 5RM, pace, jump asymmetry) normalized by baseline.
= normalize(delta_primary_kpi)

If you want, I can:

Auto‑populate joints/muscles per movement with sane defaults,

Generate SQL upserts for Supabase from your edited CSV,

Or wire this to the Atomic Movement Library schema I created earlier so your app pulls these rows instead of hard‑coded text.

Send me your edited CSV, and I’ll convert it straight into ready‑to‑insert SQL (and flag anything sloppy).

You said:
flexibility and mobility are not the same thing. range of motion is also very different. some of these metrics apply to joints, some to muscles, some to a combination.
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 9s

You’re right. You’re currently conflating flexibility, mobility, and range of motion—and mixing joint vs. muscle targets. If you don’t fix the ontology now, your “metrics” will be incoherent and your progress signals will be garbage.

Here’s a clean, brutally precise model you can implement today.

1) Precise definitions (use these, not the internet mush)

Range of Motion (ROM) = how much a joint can move (in degrees).

Passive ROM (PROM): externally assisted (therapist, strap, gravity).

Active ROM (AROM): athlete moves themselves (often lower than PROM).

Target: joint (never a muscle).

Flexibility = extensibility of a muscle–tendon unit.

Measured as muscle length proxy (e.g., SLR angle as a proxy for hamstring length), or specific tests (Thomas test).

Target: muscle (or muscle group), reported in degrees/cm or categorical pass/fail.

Mobility = ability to express usable AROM under control and often under load/speed in a task context.

This is functional; it sits on top of ROM + motor control + stability.

Target: movement (pattern or exercise), with quality/constraint metrics (tempo, symmetry, valgus angle, depth).

Keep them separate in data, scoring, and UI. Never collapse them into one “flexibility/mobility/rom” bucket.

2) Schema changes (do this now)

Extend the metric spec to encode what you’re measuring and on what:

json
Copy
Edit
{
"metricId": "ham_arom_slr_deg",
"name": "Active Straight-Leg Raise (AROM)",
"unit": "deg",
"evalMethod": "cv | self_report | coach | sensor",
"target": { "type": "joint" | "muscle" | "movement", "id": "hip" | "hamstrings" | "squat" },
"mode": "passive | active | loaded | speed",
"context": { "side": "left|right|both", "stance": "single|bilateral", "load": "kg|null", "tempo": "3-1-1-0|null" },
"quality": { "control": true, "compensationFlags": ["pelvic_tilt","valgus"] }
}


Add three separate supermetric buckets (top‑level, not tags):

joint_rom (with rom_type: passive|active)

muscle_flexibility

mobility (task‑bound quality)

Your current “functional strength, range of motion, flexibility, mobility, aerobic capacity” list becomes five independent supermetrics. Don’t merge ROM into flexibility; don’t merge flexibility into mobility.

3) Database tweaks (Supabase)

Minimal, but important:

sql
Copy
Edit
-- What the metric pertains to

4) Measurement truth table (what’s feasible & how)
Category Target Examples How you measure (today) Notes
Joint ROM Joint Hip flexion AROM/PROM, Ankle DF AROM/PROM, Shoulder ER @90° AROM: phone camera + pose angles; PROM: not from video → self/coach entry only Don’t fake PROM from video.
Flexibility Muscle Hamstring flexibility (SLR), Iliopsoas (Thomas), Gastroc (knee‑straight DF) Usually proxy via joint test + strict setup; else coach entry Label it flexibility, target muscle, and reference the proxy test you used.
Mobility Movement Overhead squat depth with thoracic extension maintained; Ankle DF in split squat CV angles + compensation flags (valgus, lumbar extension, heel lift) under a tempo/load Must include control and compensations to be mobility, not ROM.
5) Concrete mappings for items you listed

Active Straight Leg Raise (ASLR)

ROM (joint): hip_arom_slr_deg (target=joint: hip, mode=active).

Flexibility (muscle): ham_flex_slr_proxy_deg (target=muscle: hamstrings; note = “proxy via ASLR”).

Mobility: not applicable (this is a screen, not a task under load).

Overhead Squat

Mobility (movement):

ohsq_depth_percent (control load/bodyweight + tempo),

ohsq_tspine_ext_deg (thoracic extension),

ohsq_knee_valgus_deg (compensation).

ROM (joint): none directly—don’t pretend you measured shoulder PROM.

Flexibility: none directly—if you infer lat/pec tightness, label it a hypothesis, not a metric.

Lunge and Twist

Mobility (movement): lunge_depth_cm, trunk_rotation_deg, compensation flags (knee valgus, hip drop).

ROM (joint) and Flexibility: not directly unless you run a separate joint test.

Cobra / Child’s Pose

Mobility (movement/positional): spine_extension_hold_s (Cobra), spine_flexion_hold_s (Child).

ROM (joint): if you want spine ROM, you need landmarking; realistically you’ll track posture tolerance/hold not degrees.

Flexibility: could tag hip flexor or lats if you run the proper tests—don’t infer from yoga poses.

Ankle Dorsiflexion (knee-to-wall)

ROM (joint): ankle_dorsi_arom_k2w_cm (convert to degrees if you must).

Flexibility (muscle): gastroc/soleus flexibility is inferred; call it out as a proxy if you publish it.

Mobility: use split‑squat dorsiflexion under tempo as a mobility check.

6) Scoring—keep lanes separate, then compose

ROM Score (0–100): per joint, per mode (active/passive), side‑specific.
Example: score_arom_hip_flexion = clamp((AROM / 120°) * 100)

Flexibility Score (0–100): per muscle proxy, with side symmetry penalty.
Example: score_ham_flex = normalize(SLR_deg) with −X points if |L−R| > 10°

Mobility Score (0–100): composite of task depth/quality minus compensation penalties under a fixed tempo/load.
Example (OH squat): depth 40% + thoracic ext 30% + ankle demand 30% - penalties (valgus, pelvis tilt)

Then you can compose a “Movement Readiness” or “Return‑to‑Run Gate” as a weighted blend, but keep the sources visible to the athlete. No black box.

8) How this changes your UI copy (stop misleading people)

ROM screens say “Joint Range of Motion,” declare Active vs Passive, and show degrees with side labels.

Flexibility screens name the muscle, state the proxy test (e.g., “Hamstring flexibility via ASLR”), and warn about test setup.

Mobility screens are exercise‑centric (“Overhead Squat Mobility”), show depth + compensations + tempo compliance, not just a single number.

9) What I’d rip out from your current approach

Any metric labeled “mobility” that’s just AROM in disguise.

Any “flexibility” metric that references a joint as its target.

Any composite score that blends ROM, flexibility, and mobility without exposing the components.

If you want, I’ll:

Patch your movement library schema and Supabase DDL with the target and rom_mode fields above,

Generate per‑movement metric packs for Squat, Overhead Squat, ASLR, Shoulder Raise, Ankle DF (AROM, PROM placeholder, mobility), and

Add CV feature definitions for each (angles, event timing, compensation flags) so engineering isn’t guessing.

Say the word and I’ll drop the updated files and a seed bundle you can import directly.

You said:
let's focus on the definitions and vocabulary and ontology
ChatGPT said:

Alright — let’s lock the vocabulary so you’re not trying to build a product on shifting sand.
Right now you’ve got a sloppy “everything is mobility” bucket; I’ll give you a precise, non-overlapping ontology for movement, body targets, and supermetrics that will actually scale.

1. Top-level entity types

Every object in your library should clearly fall into one of these:

Entity Type Definition Examples
Pattern Abstract movement category defined by joint action & planes; no load or context implied. Squat, Hinge, Lunge/Split, Push, Pull, Brace, Rotate, Gait, Shoulder Raise
Exercise Specific implementation of a pattern with defined context (load, stance, tempo, range). Back Squat, Overhead Squat, Step-Down 20 cm, Single-Leg Heel Raise
Test/Screen Standardized movement or position used to measure a property (ROM, flexibility, mobility, strength). Active Straight Leg Raise, Thomas Test, Overhead Squat Screen
Metric A measured quantity derived from a movement, test, or pattern. Hip flexion AROM (°), Knee valgus (°), Pelvis drop (cm), Hold time (s)
Cue/Constraint Prescriptive guidance or requirement during execution. “Knee over midfoot”, “3-1-1-0 tempo”, “Pause at top”
Supermetric Conceptual performance/recovery bucket for grouping related metrics. Functional Strength, Joint ROM, Muscle Flexibility, Mobility, Aerobic Capacity, Stability
2. Supermetrics (no overlap)

These are categories of adaptation or capacity, not raw metrics themselves.

Supermetric Scope Unit Examples Target Type
Joint ROM Angular displacement a joint can achieve; specify passive vs active. ° Joint
Muscle Flexibility Extensibility of a muscle–tendon unit; often measured via a proxy joint angle in a controlled test. °, cm Muscle
Mobility Usable, controlled active ROM in a functional or loaded task; includes control & compensation assessment. °, %, cm, pass/fail Movement
Functional Strength Force or torque production in a movement context, often normalized to body mass. kg, %, N·m Movement
Aerobic Capacity Sustainable oxygen-based energy production for a given duration/intensity. min/km, W/kg, VO₂max Movement/Systemic
Stability Ability to maintain/control position under perturbation or load. cm sway, time held, error count Movement/Joint

Rule: A metric can map to only one supermetric.

3. Target types

Every metric should specify what it measures:

Target Type Definition Examples
Joint Named articulation (use ISO/ISB joint nomenclature). Ankle talocrural, Knee tibiofemoral, Hip, Glenohumeral
Muscle Named muscle or functional muscle group. Hamstrings, Quadriceps, Gastrocnemius, Hip Flexors
Movement A defined exercise or pattern. Back Squat, Overhead Press, Walking Lunge
Systemic Whole-body/physiological. Aerobic capacity, RPE
4. ROM modes (for joint targets)

Passive: External force moves joint (therapist, gravity, strap).

Active: Athlete moves under own muscle power.

Loaded: Active ROM under load (subset of mobility).

Speed: Active ROM expressed at speed (subset of mobility).

5. Relationships

Pattern → Exercise: 1-to-many (Squat → Back Squat, Overhead Squat, Goblet Squat)

Exercise → Metric(s): many-to-many (Overhead Squat → Depth %, Knee Valgus °, Thoracic Ext °)

Metric → Supermetric: many-to-1 (Knee Valgus ° → Mobility)

Metric → Target: many-to-1 (Hip flexion AROM → Joint: hip)

6. Naming rules

Metric IDs should encode target, property, mode.
ankle_dorsi_arom_deg, ham_flex_slr_proxy_deg, ohsq_depth_percent.

Patterns are verbs/nouns without context: squat, hinge, push, pull, lunge_split, brace, rotate, gait, shoulder_raise.

Exercises are patterns + modifiers: rear_foot_elev_split_squat, single_leg_heel_raise_bw.

7. Example clean mapping

Active Straight Leg Raise

Metric 1: hip_flexion_arom_aslr_deg — Supermetric: Joint ROM (target=joint: hip, mode=active)

Metric 2: ham_flex_aslr_proxy_deg — Supermetric: Muscle Flexibility (target=muscle: hamstrings)

Overhead Squat

Metric 1: ohsq_depth_percent — Supermetric: Mobility (target=movement: overhead_squat)

Metric 2: ohsq_tspine_ext_deg — Supermetric: Mobility (target=movement: overhead_squat)

Metric 3: ohsq_knee_valgus_deg — Supermetric: Mobility (compensation flag)

If you adopt this ontology:

You’ll stop conflating passive joint limits, muscle extensibility, and functional control.

You can actually write progression logic that makes sense (pass ROM before mobility; pass mobility before loading for strength).

Engineers can implement strict enums for supermetric, target_type, and rom_mode, which kills 90% of naming chaos.

Do you want me to now take your existing movement list and re-tag each one with correct pattern, target_type, and supermetric assignments so the whole thing is clean? That would make the library import-ready.

You said:
I want to be able to tag exercises (patterns?) with a level of intensity, sport, and impact across my overall plan phases(recovery, resilience, and results). some exercises are better suited for building resilience rather than recovering from an injury but that is also dependent on the level of intensity that the exercise/movement/pattern is done at I think
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 10s

You’re mixing three orthogonal ideas: what the movement is, how hard it’s done, and what phase it serves. If you don’t separate those, your plan logic will be nonsense. Here’s a clean, implementable ontology + scoring model.

1) Where to attach tags (don’t tag the wrong layer)

Pattern = abstract (squat, hinge, lunge_split, push, pull, brace, rotate, gait, shoulder_raise).
Use patterns for broad defaults only.

Exercise = concrete implementation (rear_foot_elev_split_squat, single_leg_heel_raise_bw, overhead_squat).
Tag here. Inherit from pattern only when you don’t override.

2) Intensity: a normalized scale + domain‑specific schemas

You cannot force one “intensity” schema across all exercises. Use domain schemas but convert to a normalized intensity ∈ [0,1] for scoring.

Strength skills (squat/hinge/push/pull/shoulder_raise/lunge_split)
Schema: {reps, sets, load_kg | %1RM, tempo, RPE}
Normalize: intensity_norm = max( RPE/10, %1RM/100 ) (guard for missing data).

Plyo/impact
{height_cm | distance_m, contacts, SSC_tier} → map to tiered 0–1.

Mobility/positional
{holds, hold_time_s, angle_deg, load_kg} →
intensity_norm = clamp( load_factor + end_range_factor + hold_time_factor ).

Aerobic (walk/jog/run/erg)
{duration_min, distance_km, pace, HR_zone, RPE} →
intensity_norm = max(zone/5, RPE/10).

Store both the raw schema and the computed intensity_norm.

3) Phase suitability curves (this is the key)

Different phases valorize different intensities. Model it explicitly with curves:

Let I = intensity_norm ∈ [0,1].

Recovery favors controlled low‑mod intensity; penalizes high.

mathematica
Copy
Edit
f_recovery(I) =
0 if I < 0.05
1 - ((I-0.35)/0.35)^2 for I ∈ [0.05, 0.7]
0.1 if I > 0.7


Resilience favors mid‑high with control.

mathematica
Copy
Edit
f_resilience(I) =
0 if I < 0.2
-4*(I-0.65)^2 + 1 (parabola peak at 0.65), clipped to [0,1]


Results favors high intensity.

mathematica
Copy
Edit
f_results(I) =
0 if I < 0.4
(I-0.4)/0.6 for I ∈ [0.4,1]


You can adjust constants later; the shape is what matters.

4) Base suitability by exercise × phase (intensity‑agnostic)

Create a base suitability ∈ [0,1] that captures the nature of the movement for each phase, before intensity is considered.

Examples (defaults; override per exercise):

Isometrics, positional drills, low‑impact mobility: Recovery 0.9, Resilience 0.6, Results 0.2

Unilateral strength, controlled tempo: Recovery 0.6, Resilience 0.9, Results 0.7

Heavy bilateral strength / high‑impact plyo: Recovery 0.2, Resilience 0.8, Results 0.95

Steady aerobic (Z2): Recovery 0.7, Resilience 0.8, Results 0.5

Intervals (Z4–Z5): Recovery 0.1, Resilience 0.7, Results 0.9

5) Sport relevance (don’t overfit; keep a vector)

Per exercise, store a relevance vector sport_weight[sport] ∈ [0,1] (soccer, basketball, …). Most strength patterns will be 0.5 across; sport‑specific drills spike to 0.8–1.0. This informs exercise PRIORITY, not eligibility.

6) Contraindications & injury gates

Tag each exercise with contraindications (e.g., early‑phase ACL: deep knee flexion under load; Achilles: high SSC plyo).

Compute a gate multiplier g ∈ {0, 0.25, 0.5, 1} based on injury stage + surgeon/PT flags. If gated to 0, do not prescribe.

7) Final impact score per phase

For exercise e in phase p with intensity I:

lua
Copy
Edit
impact_p(e, I) =
base_suitability_p(e) -- nature of movement
* f_phase_p(I) -- intensity curve for the phase
* sport_weight[sport_focus]^α -- optional priority toward the user’s sport (α≈0.5)
* g(e, user_injury_stage) -- gate multiplier


Scale to 0–100 for UI. This is the number you use to rank candidates and to bucket them (e.g., Recovery Day: choose top N by impact_recovery).

8) Examples (so this isn’t theoretical)

Rear‑Foot Elevated Split Squat (DB), tempo 3‑1‑1‑0, RPE 6 (I≈0.6)

Base suitability: Rec 0.6, Res 0.9, Resu 0.7

Curves: f_rec(0.6)=~0.65, f_resil(0.6)=~0.96, f_results(0.6)=~0.33

With no contraindications, no sport bias:

Recovery impact ≈ 0.6 * 0.65 = 0.39

Resilience impact ≈ 0.9 * 0.96 = 0.86

Results impact ≈ 0.7 * 0.33 = 0.23
→ This is a resilience builder at this intensity. At RPE 3 (I≈0.3), recovery impact rises; results stays low.

Single‑Leg Heel Raise (BW), 1‑s pause @ top (I≈0.25)

Base suitability: Rec 0.9, Res 0.7, Resu 0.3

f_rec(0.25)=~0.95 → Recovery impact ≈ 0.86
→ Great in recovery, less useful in results.

Run – Intervals (Z5, I≈0.9)

Base suitability: Rec 0.1, Res 0.7, Resu 0.9

f_results(0.9)=~0.83 → Results impact ≈ 0.75, Recovery ≈ ~0.01
→ Obviously results.

let sportBias = pow(ex.sportWeight[sport] ?? 0.5, 0.5) // α = 0.5
return 100.0 * base * curve * sportBias * gate
}

10) What not to do (you’re tempted, don’t)

Don’t hardcode “this is a resilience exercise.” It depends on intensity and injury stage. Use base_suitability × intensity curve × gate.

Don’t blend Recovery/Resilience/Results into one score. Keep them separate and pick per‑phase.

Don’t let coaches bypass gates silently. If they override a contraindication, log it and demand a reason.

If you want, I’ll generate:

A Supabase schema patch (tables for exercises, base_suitability, sport_weight, contraindications) and

A Swift utility that computes intensity_norm from your different schemas and returns the three impact scores + ranked recommendations for a day.

Say “ship the schema + Swift,” and I’ll drop code you can paste in today.

let's run through a detailed outline of the vocabulary around movements, intensity, sports, patterns, exercises, metrics, super metrics, what we show vs what we store, everything
ChatGPT said:

Alright — let’s nail a full-stack vocabulary for your movement library and scoring system so you’ve got a single source of truth.
This is what you’ll hand to engineers, coaches, and your content team so everyone’s speaking the same language.

1. Hierarchy of movement entities

These are conceptual layers. Don’t blur them.

Layer Definition Examples Why it exists
Pattern Abstract biomechanical category based on joint action/plane. No context, load, or tool. Squat, Hinge, Push, Pull, Lunge/Split, Brace, Rotate, Gait, Shoulder Raise Lets you group exercises for coverage analysis and defaults.
Exercise Concrete implementation of a pattern with defined context (stance, load, tool, tempo, range). Back Squat, Overhead Squat, Single-leg Heel Raise, Bulgarian Split Squat The unit you prescribe and log.
Variant (optional) Minor tweak to an exercise that doesn’t change its base ID but alters setup or target. Back Squat (high-bar), Back Squat (low-bar) Lets you avoid polluting the exercise table while tracking meaningful variations.
Test/Screen Standardized movement or position used to assess a property. Active Straight Leg Raise, Thomas Test, Overhead Squat Screen Links to metrics and gates progression.
2. Metrics

A metric = a measurable property, tied to a target and a supermetric.

Required fields for each metric:

metric_id — slug, e.g., hip_flexion_arom_deg

name — human-friendly

unit — deg, cm, sec, %, N·m, pass/fail

target_type — joint, muscle, movement, systemic

target_id — e.g., hip, hamstrings, overhead_squat

rom_mode (if ROM) — passive, active, loaded, speed

eval_method — cv, coach, self_report, sensor

supermetric — see below

context — JSON (side, stance, tempo, load)

quality_flags — e.g., compensation codes: valgus, pelvic_tilt, heel_lift

3. Supermetrics (non-overlapping)

Buckets for high-level adaptation/capacity. A metric belongs to exactly one supermetric.

Supermetric Scope Example Metric
Joint ROM Angular displacement a joint can achieve. Hip flexion AROM (°)
Muscle Flexibility Extensibility of a muscle–tendon unit. Hamstring flexibility via SLR (°)
Mobility Controlled, functional ROM under load/speed. OH squat depth %, Knee valgus °
Functional Strength Force/torque production in context. Back squat 1RM, Split squat RPE
Aerobic Capacity Sustainable oxygen-based work. 5k pace, VO₂max
Stability Control under perturbation. Single-leg stance sway cm
4. Intensity

Two layers: raw schema and normalized score.

Raw schema = phase-specific fields:

Strength: {reps, sets, load_kg | %1RM, tempo, RPE}

Mobility: {holds, hold_time_s, angle_deg, load_kg}

Aerobic: {duration_min, distance_km, pace, HR_zone, RPE}

Plyo: {contacts, height_cm, SSC_tier, RPE}

Intensity_norm = mapped to 0–1 using schema-specific formula.
This is what your scoring functions use.

5. Phases (Recovery / Resilience / Results)

Each phase has:

Base suitability per exercise (0–1) — inherent fit ignoring intensity.

Intensity curve — how suitability changes with intensity_norm.

Contraindications — hard blocks per injury stage.

6. Sports relevance

Stored as a vector: sport_weight[sport] ∈ [0,1]

Defaults at pattern level, overridden per exercise.

Use in scoring as a multiplier or priority rank, not a binary filter.

7. What we store vs what we show
Data layer What we store (DB / API) What we show (UI)
Pattern pattern_id, name, default base_suitability, default sport_weight Name, icon
Exercise All pattern fields + specific setup, base_suitability override, contraindications, default intensity_schema Name, image/video, short description
Metric Full spec (id, target, supermetric, unit, context, quality_flags) Name, unit, latest value, trend
Supermetric Enum list Phase-specific explanation for user
Intensity Raw schema + computed intensity_norm Just enough to understand effort (“Light”, “Moderate”, “High”, with numeric where relevant)
Phase impact scores Computed float 0–1 per phase per prescription Don’t show the raw number; bucket into labels (“Best for Recovery”, “Good for Resilience”)
Sports relevance sport_weight vector Show only the top 2–3 sports where relevance > 0.7
Contraindications Full list in DB Only show if active for this user’s injury stage (“Not recommended for early-phase ACL rehab”)
8. Vocabulary summary table

You said:
stability shouldn't be a super metric I think. I think of balance and stability as outcomes of having good functional strength and mobility
ChatGPT said:

Agreed — stability isn’t a primary supermetric, it’s an emergent property that comes from strength + mobility + control.

If you make it a top-level supermetric, you’ll end up double-counting in your scoring and confusing your prescription logic. It’s better to treat it as:

A quality flag on mobility/strength metrics
(e.g., “loss of balance” → compensation, “center of pressure sway” → stability index)

Or an outcome composite you calculate for reporting
(e.g., stability score = f(mobility control %, unilateral strength symmetry %))

Updated supermetric set

Primary (these are the only things an atomic metric belongs to):

Joint ROM – joint angle capacity (active/passive)

Muscle Flexibility – extensibility of muscle–tendon unit

Mobility – controlled, functional active ROM in task context

Functional Strength – force/torque production in task context

Aerobic Capacity – sustained oxidative performance

(Optional later) Power – high-rate force production (separate from strength)

Derived (calculated from primaries, never directly tagged):

Stability / Balance

Agility

Endurance (muscular or sport-specific)

Resilience Index

Why this separation matters

Storage: Every metric has exactly one primary supermetric, so queries like “show all functional strength metrics” are unambiguous.

Scoring: You blend primaries into phase scores (Recovery, Resilience, Results). Stability can be reported, but it’s a downstream KPI not a prescription driver by itself.

UI: You can still show “Balance improved by +12%” but under the hood it’s a combination of:

unilateral strength ratio improvements

mobility control improvements

reduced compensation flags in dynamic tasks

If you want, I can show you exactly how I’d model stability as a derived score:

Which underlying metrics feed it

How to weight them

How to surface it in the app without bloating your supermetric list

Do you want me to sketch that?

You said:
we are looking to target people with nagging pain or injuries like calf strains, IT band pain, shin splits, quad or hamstring strains, limited shoulder mobility, tight hips what are the right movements we should start with in our library
ChatGPT said:

If you’re targeting that group — basically chronic, low-grade tissue irritations and joint restrictions — your starting library should cover:

Movements that restore baseline joint ROM & muscle flexibility in the affected area

Low- to mid-intensity strength/mobility drills that re-load tissues safely

Patterns that re-integrate that ROM/strength into functional movement without high peak forces

You don’t start with sexy plyos or heavy lifts — you start with restore → re-load → re-integrate.

1. Foundational categories

We should seed with at least one movement in each of these:

Area Primary Goal Examples
Ankle/Calf Improve dorsiflexion, rebuild calf/soleus strength, low-impact SSC Ankle dorsiflexion stretch (knee-to-wall), Seated calf raise (bent knee), Standing calf raise (straight knee), Soleus wall sit
Shin (tibialis) Anterior tibialis endurance/strength Tibialis raise against wall, Heel walks
IT Band / Lateral Hip Glute med/min control, hip abduction Side-lying hip abduction, Banded lateral walk, Single-leg RDL
Hamstring Restore length + eccentric strength Active straight leg raise, Supine hamstring slider curl, Nordic hamstring lower (partial)
Quadriceps Controlled loading, eccentric tolerance Step-down from low box, Spanish squat hold, Terminal knee extension (band)
Hip Flexors / Tight Hips Increase hip extension ROM, integrate into gait Half-kneeling hip flexor stretch, Couch stretch, Split squat isometric
Shoulder / Overhead Mobility Thoracic extension, scap upward rotation, GH flexion Wall slides, Prone Y-T-W lift, Overhead band distraction
Core/Trunk Control Brace under movement, anti-rotation Dead bug, Pallof press, Bird dog
2. Patterns to focus on

For this population, your first wave should be:

Squat → only in controlled ROM (box squat to set height, TRX assisted squat)

Hinge → hip hinge drill, RDL with light load

Lunge/Split → split squat isometric, step-through

Push (upper) → wall push-up, incline push-up (reduce shoulder demand)

Pull (upper) → banded row, scap retraction

Brace → dead bug, side plank

Gait → walk, walk with posture cueing, backward walk (retro step for knee/quad re-loading)

3. Early-phase selection rules

Low intensity_norm (0.2–0.4) initially; can creep to 0.6 in resilience phase.

Contraindication filters active by tissue type (e.g., no deep knee flexion for acute quad strain).

Mobility work first → loaded work → dynamic work.

Only one “provocative” movement per session (forces adaptation without overload).

No high-impact SSC until pain-free in both recovery and resilience impact scores.

4. Example starting set (20 movements)
Mobility / ROM / Flexibility

Ankle DF – knee-to-wall

Hip flexor – half-kneeling stretch

5. Why this set works for your population

Covers all the target tissues you listed without exposing them to high loads or velocities early.

Each movement can be progressed in-place (increase hold, load, ROM, tempo) so you don’t need 100 new exercises to keep someone in the plan.

Each movement has a clear metric to track: ROM degrees, reps to fatigue, pain score during/after.

If you want, I can take this set and:

Assign pattern, supermetric, base_suitability (Recovery/Resilience/Results)

Pre-fill contraindications by injury type

Give you progression chains (e.g., Soleus wall sit → Standing calf raise → Plyo pogo)
So your plan builder can actually slot them in logically.

Do you want me to build that as an import-ready CSV for your movement library?

our initially assessment will likely be a subset of these movements: 1. Overhead Squat
Knee valgus/varus angle (frontal plane knee deviation)
Hip-knee-ankle alignment (e.g., tibial angle vs. femur angle)
Thoracic spine extension angle
Shoulder flexion angle (arms in line with torso or forward drift)
Pelvic tilt and depth of squat (posterior/anterior tilt, sacral angle)
Heel lift / ankle dorsiflexion angle
Trunk lean angle (hip-to-shoulder angle relative to vertical)

2. Active Straight Leg Raise
Hip flexion range of motion (ROM) of the raised leg
Contralateral leg stability (unintended movement or compensation)
Pelvic rotation or tilt during movement
Knee extension angle (is the leg truly straight?)

Assuming this is an arm raise in the scapular or frontal plane
Shoulder flexion or abduction angle
Scapular upward rotation (approximated)
Thoracic compensation or lumbar extension
Symmetry between left and right raises
Neck posture and tension (e.g., elevation of shoulders)

4. Dorsiflexion Ankle Test
Typically a weight-bearing lunge

3. What’s scored vs. what’s flagged

Scored = quantifiable, repeatable metrics (degrees, cm, %, yes/no with clear threshold) that can be compared over time

Flagged = qualitative/compensation cues that influence interpretation but aren’t directly in the improvement % calculation

Example for OHSQ:

Score: knee valgus °, thoracic ext °, shoulder flex °, heel lift present/absent

Flag: asymmetric arm path, excessive trunk lean, facial grimace/pain cue

4. Mapping into Recovery / Resilience / Results

Recovery: Primary focus is restoring joint ROM & muscle flexibility
→ child’s pose, cobra, ankle DF test, ASLR, cervical mobility are baseline gates

Resilience: Integrate mobility into loaded patterns with control
→ OHSQ, shoulder raise, hinge patterns under load

Results: Loaded, complex versions of these patterns
→ Weighted OHSQ, loaded hinges, loaded PVC arm raise (press integration)

If you want, I can turn this list into an import-ready CSV for your library with:

movement_id

pattern

Full list of metrics for each

Target types & supermetrics

Phase suitability (0–1)

Placeholder intensity schemas

That way your first assessment battery is fully structured in the same ontology we’ve been building.

You said:
okay how would you integrate or relabel if necessary these movements with the notion of pattern vs exercise vs movement
ChatGPT said:

Right now you’re calling them “movements,” but in your ontology they actually split into patterns and screens/exercises.

Here’s how I’d integrate and relabel so they fit cleanly into Pattern → Exercise/Test → Metrics without muddying definitions.

1. Pattern assignment

Patterns are abstract biomechanical categories — they don’t have context like load or test protocol.

Assessment name Pattern Why
Overhead Squat squat Bilateral, axial-loaded squat pattern (even if bodyweight)
Active Straight Leg Raise screen_hamstring_length Primarily a hip flexion + hamstring length test, not a hinge or squat
Shoulder Raise shoulder_raise Isolated shoulder flexion/abduction pattern
Child’s Pose flexion_spine Passive spinal flexion pattern
Cobra Pose extension_spine Passive spinal extension pattern
Standing Hinge – Normal Stance hinge Hip hinge pattern with neutral stance
2. Exercise/Test naming

In your DB, each assessment gets stored as a specific exercise or test linked to its pattern.
This makes it easy to later add non-assessment exercises to the same pattern family.

Pattern Exercise/Test ID Display Name
squat ohs_bodyweight_assessment Overhead Squat (Assessment)
screen_hamstring_length aslr_unloaded Active Straight Leg Raise
shoulder_raise shoulder_raise_unloaded Shoulder Raise (Unloaded)
flexion_spine child_pose_passive Child’s Pose (Passive)
extension_spine cobra_pose_passive Cobra Pose (Passive)
hinge hinge_normal_bw_assessment Standing Hinge – Normal Stance
3. Movement vs. Exercise vs. Pattern in UI

Pattern = used internally for grouping & default suitability. Rarely shown directly to the user.

Exercise/Test = what the user sees (“Overhead Squat”), with context baked in (assessment, loaded, assisted, etc.).

Movement (if you use this term in UX) = could be a generic user-facing label, but in your backend it should map 1:1 to an Exercise/Test ID.

4. Relabeling to avoid UX confusion

Right now “movement” could mean any of the three layers, which will cause mess.
I’d suggest:

In the backend: only use pattern, exercise_id, test_id, metric_id.

In the app UI: say “Movement Assessment” if it’s an assessment, “Exercise” if it’s training.
E.g., “Overhead Squat Assessment” on an intake screen.

If you want, I can go ahead and:

Assign pattern IDs, exercise IDs, and display names to all 6 assessments

Build the metric lists for each with target type, supermetric, and ROM mode

Give you a clean CSV/JSON that’s ready to drop into your movement library backend

Do you want me to prepare that structured file next?

You said:
the notion of a test or assessment exercise is really just context right? like a squat can be used as a workout or to assess mobility in a certain way
ChatGPT said:

Exactly — “test” or “assessment” isn’t a fundamentally different thing in your ontology, it’s context + intent applied to an exercise.

The core entity — your exercise — doesn’t change whether you’re using it to assess or to train.
What changes is:

Execution context – load, tempo, setup, allowable reps, coaching cues

Data capture mode – what metrics you record and how you score them

Evaluation goal – baseline/diagnostic vs progression/conditioning

How this works in your model

Pattern = squat, hinge, push, pull, etc.

Exercise = squat (bodyweight, heels elevated), hinge (PVC), shoulder raise (frontal plane).

Context fields define how it’s being used:

json
Copy
Edit
{
"use_case": "assessment" | "training",
"assessment_focus": ["ankle_dorsi", "tspine_ext", "shoulder_flexion"],
"load": "bodyweight",
"tempo": "controlled",
"metric_capture": "video_cv"
}


Metrics = same atomic measures regardless of use case (e.g., knee valgus °, thoracic extension °), but in assessment context you store + interpret them as a baseline/gate, while in training context you might only track RPE, sets, load.

Why it’s important not to split them into separate “assessment” entities

Reusability: One exercise definition, many contexts → no duplication of technique notes, contraindications, sport relevance.

Progression continuity: If “Overhead Squat” appears in Week 0 for assessment and Week 8 for training, your history graph shows the same movement evolving.

Maintenance: You don’t have to update two copies if the movement standard changes.

How you’d surface this in your UI

Assessment mode: Fixed protocol, scoring overlay, no “workout” timers.

Training mode: Load/RPE targets, sets/reps logging, may still record video for form tracking but not as strictly standardized.

If you want, I can take your 6 starting assessments and:

Keep them as single exercise definitions in the library

Add an assessment_profile for each: which metrics, positions, and scoring rules to run when in “assessment” context

Show how the same exercise appears in “training” context later in a plan

Do you want me to mock that out?

You said:
okay so what would the full starting list of exercises in the atomic exercise library be
ChatGPT said:

If you want a usable Atomic Exercise Library seed — not just assessment drills — for your target population (nagging pain, mobility restrictions, soft-tissue strains), the starting set should:

Cover all fundamental patterns (squat, hinge, lunge, push, pull, brace, rotate, gait)

Include the 6 assessments (context = assessment)

Include early-phase recovery variants of those patterns

Include progression options for resilience/results phases

1. Squat pattern

Overhead Squat (assessment context)

Box Squat to Bench (controlled depth)

Goblet Squat (light load)

TRX Assisted Squat

2. Hinge pattern

Standing Hinge – Normal Stance (assessment context)

Hip Hinge Drill with PVC

Romanian Deadlift (light load, DB)

Single-Leg RDL (bodyweight)

3. Lunge/Split pattern

Split Squat Isometric Hold

Step-Down from Low Box

Banded Terminal Knee Extension

Reverse Lunge (bodyweight)

4. Push (upper)

Shoulder Raise (assessment context)

Wall Push-Up

Incline Push-Up

Half-Kneeling Landmine Press (light)

5. Pull (upper)

Banded Row

Scapular Retraction (band)

Prone Y-T-W Lift

6. Brace / Core

Dead Bug

Bird Dog

Side Plank (kneeling or full)

Pallof Press

7. Rotate

Half-Kneeling Cable/Band Rotation

Tall-Kneeling Anti-Rotation Hold (Pallof variant)

8. Gait / Foot-Ankle

Heel Walks

Calf Raise – Straight Knee (gastroc)

9. Mobility/Stretch (positional)

Child’s Pose (assessment context)

Cobra Pose (assessment context)

Half-Kneeling Hip Flexor Stretch

90/90 Hip Rotation Drill

Thoracic Extension over Foam Roller

Sleeper Stretch (shoulder IR)

10. Hamstring-specific

Active Straight Leg Raise (assessment context)

Supine Hamstring Slider Curl

Nordic Hamstring Lower (partial ROM)

Total seed count

6 assessments (used in assessment context)

~30 early-phase and progression exercises

Why this works for you now

Covers every pattern → you can build balanced programs without gaps

Recovery-safe variants → most movements can be scaled to low load & low velocity

Progressions baked in → each pattern has a clear pathway to resilience/results phases

Reusability → the same atomic exercise can be used in assessment or training contexts

If you want, I can:

Put this into an Atomic Exercise Library CSV/JSON with:

pattern

exercise_id

display_name

contraindications

base_suitability for Recovery/Resilience/Results

assessment_profile where relevant

Link the 6 assessments to their metric lists so the app can automatically score them.

Do you want me to generate that structured file for you?

You said:
what is the list of patterns look like
ChatGPT said:

For your purposes, the patterns should be a short, fixed enum — broad enough to group exercises logically, but not so broad that you can’t meaningfully set defaults for intensity curves, sport relevance, and phase suitability.

Here’s what I’d recommend as your atomic pattern list:

Primary Movement Patterns
Pattern ID Description Examples
squat Bilateral knee/hip-dominant lowering/lifting in sagittal plane Back squat, Goblet squat, Overhead squat
hinge Hip-dominant flexion/extension with minimal knee movement Romanian deadlift, Hip hinge drill
lunge_split Unilateral stance with hip/knee flexion-extension Split squat, Step-up, Reverse lunge
push Upper-body pushing in horizontal/vertical plane Push-up, Overhead press, Wall push-up
pull Upper-body pulling in horizontal/vertical plane Row, Pull-up, Face pull
brace Trunk anti-movement (anti-extension, anti-rotation, anti-lateral flexion) Plank, Pallof press, Dead bug
rotate Trunk rotation or resisted anti-rotation Cable rotation, Medicine ball throw
gait Locomotion involving alternating limb cycles Walking, Jogging, Running
shoulder_raise Isolated GH flexion/abduction Shoulder raise (frontal/scapular plane)
Mobility / Positional Patterns (often passive or low load)
Pattern ID Description Examples
flexion_spine Spinal flexion in sagittal plane Child’s pose, Seated forward fold
extension_spine Spinal extension in sagittal plane Cobra pose, Prone press-up
rotation_spine Spinal rotation in transverse plane Open book stretch, Thoracic rotation on hands and knees
hip_rotation Hip IR/ER in various positions 90/90 drill, Prone hip IR
Screen / Test Patterns (optional flag, not a separate type)

These are tags applied to an existing pattern when the movement is performed in a standardized test context:

screen_hamstring_length (Active Straight Leg Raise) → underlying pattern: hip flexion

screen_overhead_squat (OHSQ) → underlying pattern: squat

screen_hinge (Standing Hinge) → underlying pattern: hinge

Why keep it this short:

Your “pattern” field should be predictable — no synonyms or duplicates.

Patterns drive default phase suitability, intensity curves, and sport weights in your scoring.

Specificity belongs in the exercise layer, not the pattern layer.

If you want, I can take your full exercise seed list from earlier and tag every single one with the correct pattern_id from this set so your DB is consistent from day one.

Do you want me to run that tagging pass?

You said:
some of the context and variation is equipment based right? it seems like the context that is added to an exercise is injury relevance, equipment required, and intensity. then there is a notion of tagging exercises with assessment impact, super metric impact, sport impact, goal impact, and phase of plan (recovery, resilience, results) impact. is there a difference between context and tagging after the fact?
ChatGPT said:

Yeah — what you’re describing is actually two different things:

Context → properties of how an exercise is prescribed/performed in a given instance

Tags/Attributes → intrinsic properties of the exercise definition itself that persist across uses

1. Context (dynamic, per prescription)

This is instance-specific — it can change every time you use the same exercise in a program.

Example fields:

Equipment used: bodyweight, dumbbell, barbell, resistance band, TRX, etc.
(Sometimes optional if the exercise can be done multiple ways)

Intensity parameters: reps, sets, load, tempo, hold time, pace, RPE → converted to intensity_norm

Injury relevance for this athlete in this plan: e.g., “post-ACL surgery clearance”

Use case: training vs assessment

Modifications: e.g., heels elevated, ROM restricted, tempo slowed

Environment: in-clinic, home, outdoors

Think of context as the JSON blob attached to a workout prescription:

json
Copy
Edit
{
"exercise_id": "hinge_normal_bw",
"equipment": ["PVC pipe"],
"sets": 3,
"reps": 10,
"tempo": "3-1-1-0",
"RPE": 5,
"use_case": "assessment"
}

2. Tags/Attributes (static, per exercise definition)

This is metadata baked into the exercise in the library — it doesn’t change unless you edit the library entry.

Example fields:

Pattern: hinge, squat, push, etc.

Base suitability: default fit for Recovery/Resilience/Results (before intensity curve)

Supermetric impact: mobility, joint_rom, functional_strength, aerobic_capacity

Assessment impact: list of metrics this movement can produce if used in assessment context

Sport relevance vector: {soccer: 0.7, basketball: 0.5, …}

Goal relevance vector: {increase_rom: 0.8, build_strength: 0.6, reduce_pain: 0.9}

Required equipment: minimum needed to perform the standard version

Contraindications: tissue/joint states where it should be avoided

Example exercise library entry:

json
Copy
Edit
{
"exercise_id": "hinge_normal_bw",
"pattern": "hinge",
"required_equipment": ["PVC pipe"],
"base_suitability": { "recovery": 0.7, "resilience": 0.9, "results": 0.6 },
"supermetric_impact": ["mobility"],
"assessment_metrics": ["hinge_hip_angle_deg", "hinge_spinal_neutrality_score"],
"sport_relevance": { "soccer": 0.6, "basketball": 0.5 },
"goal_relevance": { "increase_rom": 0.8, "build_strength": 0.6 },
"contraindications": ["acute_low_back_pain"]
}

Key differences
Aspect Context Tags/Attributes
Scope One instance of an exercise in a plan The definition in the library
Mutable? Yes, every time you prescribe it No, unless you edit the library
Stored where? In workout/program data In exercise library metadata
Purpose Describe how it’s done this time Describe what it is in general
Why it matters

You avoid duplicating “hinge_normal_bw_assessment” and “hinge_normal_bw_training” as two separate exercises — instead, it’s hinge_normal_bw with different context.

Recommendation/scoring logic uses tags/attributes to filter/select, then applies context (intensity, injury relevance) to calculate phase impact scores.

This separation makes your library maintainable and your prescriptions flexible.

If you want, I can make you a canonical schema for your Atomic Exercise Library that cleanly separates:

Static attributes (pattern, base suitability, etc.)

Dynamic context fields

All tagging dimensions (supermetric, sport, goal, phase)

That way, engineers know exactly what’s in the library vs. what’s only in a plan.

Do you want me to draft that schema?

You said:
yes draft the schema

7) What we store vs show (practical)

Store: full exercise, metric, prescription, assessment_result, plus raw intensity_schema, intensity_norm, and the three phase impacts as raw floats (for audit).

Show: labels (“Best for Resilience”, “Intensity: Moderate”), selected metrics with trends, not the raw multipliers/curves.

8) Implementation notes (don’t skip)

Make pattern, supermetric, phase, target_type, rom_mode, use_case strict enums in app code.

Keep phase curves configurable server-side.

All weights and suitability numbers are 0–1; clamp and validate.

Version every exercise and metric; snapshot assessment profiles on change.

Keep injury gates (contraindications → gate_multiplier) in one rules table; never hardcode in the app.

If you want this as ready-to-import files (JSON Schemas, SQL, and Swift files) I can generate them so your team can drop them into the repo and get moving immediately.

You said:
let's remove power for now. can you give me a flatten list of every possible metric? also how are modifications handled again?
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 6s

Here’s a flattened starter catalog of metrics (with power removed from the supermetrics). I generated it as a table you can edit and as JSON for your backend:

CSV: metric_catalog.csv

JSON: metric_catalog.json

Each metric has: metric_id, name, unit, target_type, target_id, supermetric, rom_mode, eval_method, notes.

This covers your 6 current assessments (Overhead Squat, ASLR, Shoulder Raise, Child’s Pose, Cobra, Standing Hinge – Normal) plus the minimal training-side functional strength/aerobic placeholders and common compensation flags. It’s meant to be complete for what you’ve scoped now, not “every metric in the universe.”

If you want me to expand it (e.g., add knee‑to‑wall, cervical tests, plyo when you’re ready), say so and I’ll extend the catalog.

How modifications are handled (recap)

Modifications are context, not new exercises. Things like heels elevated, ROM limited, band‑assisted, stance width, grip, box height, camera view are dynamic fields on the prescription — they don’t create a new exercise_id.

Minimal schema sketch for modifications:

json
Copy
Edit
{
"exercise_id": "ohs_bodyweight",
"use_case": "assessment|training",
"equipment_used": ["bodyweight","heels_wedge_5cm"],
"modifiers": {
"stance": "shoulder_width",
"heels_elevated_cm": 5,
"grip": "snatch",
"box_height_cm": null,
"rom_limit_deg": null,
"camera_view": "frontal|sagittal"
},
"intensity_schema": { "sets": 3, "reps": 8, "tempo": "3-1-1-0", "RPE": 6 },
"intensity_norm": 0.6,
"phase": "resilience"
}


When to promote a modification to its own exercise:
Only if the technique standard, coaching cues, or contraindications materially change (e.g., rear‑foot elevated split squat is a distinct exercise vs “split squat with small heel wedge”).

Want me to pre‑tag your existing exercise list with likely modifiers fields (per pattern) and wire those into your prescription model so coaches can set them from the UI?

You said:
also can there be things that are the opposite of contraindications
ChatGPT said:

Yes — the “opposite” of a contraindication is essentially an indication or recommendation, and in exercise programming it’s usually called something like:

Preferred Use Cases

Primary Indications

Target Conditions

Best For

Prescription Drivers

Why you might want them in your schema

They give the positive logic to complement contraindications (which are purely exclusionary).

They let your recommendation engine boost exercises that are especially effective for a given joint issue, limitation, or sport requirement.

They help with filtering in the UI — “Show me movements good for tight hips” vs “Hide movements risky for lumbar disc injury.”

Examples

Contraindication:

Avoid deep loaded squat for acute meniscus tear.

Indication:

Recommended for improving ankle dorsiflexion in post-ankle sprain rehab (stage 2+).

How it could look in the library schema

"pattern": "flexion_spine",
"contraindications": ["acute_knee_pain","post_spinal_surgery<6wks"],

"supermetric_impact": ["joint_rom","muscle_flexibility"],
"base_suitability": { "recovery": 0.9, "resilience": 0.7, "results": 0.3 }
}


Contraindications → exclusion logic (gate_multiplier=0 or 0.25 in scoring).

Indications → positive relevance boost in ranking/recommendation.

Both fields should use controlled vocabularies (same term set for both).

Controlled vocabulary examples for indications/contraindications

Joint conditions: ankle_dorsiflexion_limit, hip_ir_limit, lumbar_instability

Tissue status: hamstring_strain_stage1, calf_strain_resolved

Movement faults: valgus_collapse, limited_tspine_ext

Sport demands: overhead_stability_required, change_of_direction_speed

If you want, I can:

Add indications to your schema next to contraindications.

Pre-populate your 6 core assessment exercises with a starter set of indications that match the athlete pain points you’re targeting (tight hips, IT band pain, hamstring tightness, limited shoulder mobility, etc.).

Do you want me to draft that pre-populated table?

You said:
why is the assessment context separated? shouldn't the pattern be different from that element of the context (assessment)
ChatGPT said:

Exactly — the assessment/training distinction is not a pattern.

Right now I separated the “assessment context” just to show which of your exercises are currently intended to be used for intake tests, but in the actual ontology:

Pattern = biomechanical category (squat, hinge, push, pull, etc.)

Context = how you’re using it this time — "assessment" or "training" (and maybe "rehab_drill", "warmup", etc. in the future)

So in your data model:

json
Copy
Edit
{
"exercise_id": "ohs_bodyweight",
"pattern": "squat",
"use_case": "assessment" // <- context, not part of pattern
}


That means:

Overhead Squat stays in the squat pattern.

In your plan prescription, you set use_case: "assessment" for baseline testing, and later use_case: "training" for loaded work.

The assessment profile is just a block of extra metadata on the exercise definition so the app knows which metrics to capture when it’s in that context.

If you want, I can rewrite your full exercise list without splitting “assessment” into its own section, so it’s just grouped by pattern. Then we can separately list the available contexts as a fixed enum.

Do you want me to restructure it that way?

You said:
yes from the top please
ChatGPT said:

Alright — here’s the from-scratch clean version with pattern, exercise list, contexts, and tags/attributes separated correctly.

1. Patterns (fixed enum)

Broad biomechanical categories only.

Primary movement patterns

squat – Bilateral knee/hip-dominant lowering/lifting

hinge – Hip-dominant flexion/extension with minimal knee movement

lunge_split – Unilateral stance with hip/knee flexion/extension

push – Upper-body pushing (horizontal/vertical)

pull – Upper-body pulling (horizontal/vertical)

brace – Trunk anti-movement (anti-extension, anti-rotation, anti-lateral flexion)

rotate – Trunk rotation or resisted anti-rotation

gait – Locomotion involving alternating limb cycles

shoulder_raise – Isolated GH flexion/abduction

Mobility / positional patterns

flexion_spine – Spinal flexion

extension_spine – Spinal extension

rotation_spine – Spinal rotation

hip_rotation – Hip IR/ER in various positions

2. Contexts (use_case fixed enum)

Execution intent for the prescription.

assessment – Standardized form, metrics captured/scored

training – General programming, load/progression focus

(optional future) rehab_drill, warmup, mobility_drill

3. Tags / Attributes (static, per exercise definition)

Persistent metadata in the library:

pattern – from enum above

required_equipment – minimal gear needed for standard execution

supermetric_impact – which supermetrics it primarily develops (joint_rom, muscle_flexibility, mobility, functional_strength, aerobic_capacity)

base_suitability – default fit for recovery, resilience, results phases (0–1 scores)

contraindications – structured list of conditions where it should be avoided

indications – structured list of conditions/goals it’s especially good for

assessment_profile – metrics to capture if use_case=assessment

sport_weight – per-sport relevance mapping (0–1)

goal_weight – per-goal relevance mapping (0–1)

If you want, I can now map every exercise in this list to:

pattern

required_equipment

supermetric_impact

default base_suitability

empty contraindications/indications placeholders

empty assessment_profile (except for the 6 assessments)

…so you’ve got a single clean JSON/CSV your app can actually load.

Do you want me to generate that file next?

You said:
is there any benefit to separating the primary movement patterns from the mobility/positional patterns?
ChatGPT said:

Short answer: yes, there’s real value in separating them—but only if you do it cleanly. Primary movement patterns and mobility/positional patterns behave differently across intensity, scoring, contraindications, and CV measurement. If you lump them together, you’ll either cripple defaults or hard‑code exceptions everywhere.

Why separate (the benefits)

Different intensity schemas

Primary patterns (squat/hinge/push/pull/lunge/brace/rotate/gait) use load, reps, tempo, RPE.

Mobility/positional (spine flex/extend/rotate, hip IR/ER) use holds, end‑range angle, time under position, sometimes zero load.
Unifying these under one pattern set means special‑case logic in every prescription and scoring function. Separation lets you attach the right schema by default.

Different phase curves

Recovery favors low/mod intensity for mobility/positional; resilience/results curves barely apply.

Strength patterns want mid/high intensity for resilience/results.
If you don’t separate, your phase impact curves become a tangle of “if pattern ∈ {these 4} then use curve B…”.

Different supermetric emphasis

Primary patterns: functional_strength + mobility.

Positional patterns: joint_rom + muscle_flexibility (and some mobility control).
Having them in distinct buckets keeps supermetric reporting and recommendations sane.

Cleaner contraindications & indications

Positional work is often a test or tolerable range gate (e.g., lumbar flexion in Child’s Pose).

Primary patterns carry load & velocity risks (e.g., deep knee flexion under load).
The rule sets and gates differ; separating avoids mushy “contraindication applies only when load_kg > 0” hacks.

Measurement reliability

Positional patterns are better for ROM (degrees) with standardized camera setup.

Primary patterns are better for mobility/control (quality under load/speed).
Splitting patterns makes it explicit what you intend to measure.

Coach UX
Filtering “show me mobility drills for tight hips” shouldn’t return loaded squats unless explicitly requested. Separate categories make search and templates straightforward.

Risks if you don’t separate

Your intensity_norm mapping becomes inconsistent or meaningless for positional work.

Phase scoring requires nested exceptions that will rot.

You’ll mislabel ROM as “mobility” because the pattern defaults push you there.

Onboarding new content editors becomes error‑prone (“is Child’s Pose a squat variant?”).

A practical structure (no overengineering)

Keep one patterns enum, but add a pattern_type field to each pattern:

json
Copy
Edit
{
"pattern_id": "squat",
"pattern_type": "primary", // primary | positional
"intensity_schema": "strength", // strength | mobility | aerobic
"default_supermetrics": ["mobility","functional_strength"]
}


Examples:

squat: pattern_type=primary, intensity_schema=strength

hinge: primary, strength

lunge_split: primary, strength

push/pull/brace/rotate: primary, strength (brace uses “strength-control” variant)

gait: primary, aerobic

flexion_spine / extension_spine / rotation_spine / hip_rotation: positional, intensity_schema=mobility

Why this is better than two separate enums:

One source of truth for patterns (no duplicate names).

You still get different defaults and curves by switching on pattern_type and intensity_schema.

Queries stay simple: WHERE pattern_type='positional' for ROM work.

What changes in your current schema

Add pattern_type (primary|positional) and intensity_schema to Pattern.

Keep exercises mapped to a single pattern as before.

Phase curves: bind two curve families and select by pattern_type.

Primary: use your existing Recovery/Resilience/Results curves.

Positional: Recovery curve only (Resilience/Results flatten near 0.3–0.5 intensity), or use a much flatter set.

Validation: enforce that positional patterns don’t accept strength-only fields (load_kg optional, holds/hold_time_s required).

Example defaults (how code stays clean)
json
Copy
Edit
// Pattern defaults
{ "pattern_id":"squat", "pattern_type":"primary", "intensity_schema":"strength",
"default_supermetrics":["mobility","functional_strength"] }

{ "pattern_id":"flexion_spine", "pattern_type":"positional", "intensity_schema":"mobility",
"default_supermetrics":["joint_rom","muscle_flexibility"] }


When authoring an exercise:

If pattern_type=positional, your editor only shows holds/angle/time fields and ROM metrics.

If pattern_type=primary, you get sets/reps/load/tempo/RPE and mobility/strength metrics.
No conditionals spamming your UI with irrelevant fields.

Migration plan (15 minutes of work that saves months later)

Add pattern_type and intensity_schema to the patterns table.

Backfill:

primary: squat, hinge, lunge_split, push, pull, brace, rotate, gait, shoulder_raise

positional: flexion_spine, extension_spine, rotation_spine, hip_rotation

Update phase scoring to branch by pattern_type.

Lock authoring UI: intensity fields shown per intensity_schema.

Validation rules for exercises: positional patterns require holds/hold_time_s and allow angle_deg; primary patterns require sets/reps (or explicit isometric schema).

If you insist on not separating

Minimum viable guardrails:

Keep one enum but enforce intensity schema per pattern anyway.

Maintain two metric palettes (ROM vs mobility/strength) and tie them to patterns.

Add linting: positional pattern + load_kg>0 throws a warning unless explicitly allowed.

Bottom line

Separating via a pattern_type flag gives you all the benefits (correct defaults, clean scoring, safer authoring, clearer analytics) without fragmenting your pattern list. If you don’t draw this line, you’ll keep paying a complexity tax in scoring, UI, and content QA forever.

You said:
okay so what are all the pattern types
ChatGPT said:

Based on where you are now, I’d define pattern types narrowly enough to drive defaults and scoring, but broadly enough that you’re not creating one-off types for edge cases.

Here’s the list that covers your library and still scales:

Pattern Types

primary

Definition: Full-body or multi-joint movement patterns that can be loaded, progressed, and trained across all plan phases.

Intensity schema: Sets, reps, load, tempo, RPE (or equivalent aerobic schema for gait).

Typical supermetric impact: functional_strength, mobility (sometimes aerobic_capacity for gait).

Examples: Squat, hinge, push, pull, lunge_split, brace, rotate, gait, shoulder_raise.

positional

Definition: Primarily static or low-load positions and controlled ROM drills, often used for mobility, flexibility, or assessment.

Intensity schema: Holds, angle (degrees), time under position, sometimes reps for controlled mobilization.

Typical supermetric impact: joint_rom, muscle_flexibility, mobility.

Examples: Flexion_spine (Child’s Pose), extension_spine (Cobra), rotation_spine (Open Book), hip_rotation (90/90 drill).

isolation (optional — you can fold into primary if you want fewer types)

Definition: Single-joint strengthening patterns, often accessory work targeting a specific muscle group.

Intensity schema: Sets, reps, load, tempo.

Typical supermetric impact: functional_strength, muscle_flexibility.

Examples: Calf raise variations, biceps curl, shoulder external rotation with band.

Note: If you don’t care to split this, keep them as primary but tag target_type="joint" in the metrics.

aerobic (optional — could be a sub-schema of primary gait)

Definition: Continuous cyclical movements with cardiovascular focus.

Intensity schema: Duration, distance, pace, HR zone.

Typical supermetric impact: aerobic_capacity, sometimes mobility.

Examples: Walking, jogging, backward walking, cycling.

Note: Gait pattern can just carry intensity_schema=aerobic instead of its own type.

The practical implementation

I’d store these in your patterns table like this:

pattern_id pattern_type intensity_schema
squat primary strength
hinge primary strength
lunge_split primary strength
push primary strength
pull primary strength
brace primary strength_control
rotate primary strength_control
gait primary aerobic
shoulder_raise primary strength
flexion_spine positional mobility
extension_spine positional mobility
rotation_spine positional mobility
hip_rotation positional mobility

If you want, I can now take your full exercise list and assign each one:

pattern_id

pattern_type

intensity_schema

…so your backend can pull default intensity fields and phase curves automatically.

Do you want me to make that mapping table?

You said:
the pattern type allows a unique schema to be mapped to the patterns right
ChatGPT said:

Yes — that’s the main reason to bother with a pattern_type field in the first place.

It gives you a single switch in your code to:

Select the correct intensity schema

primary → sets, reps, load, tempo, RPE

positional → holds, time, angle

primary with intensity_schema=aerobic → duration, distance, pace, HR zone

primary with intensity_schema=strength_control → sets, time, RPE, quality metrics
No need for nested if pattern == squat || pattern == hinge … checks — the schema is bound to the type.

Bind phase scoring curves

You can keep two families of Recovery/Resilience/Results curves — one for strength-like patterns, one for mobility-like patterns — and

You said:
the pattern type allows a unique intensity schema to be mapped to the patterns right
ChatGPT said:

Exactly — that’s the whole point.

pattern_type is the hook that lets you say:

“All patterns of this type use this default intensity schema.”

That means:

primary → strength schema

Sets, reps, load, tempo, RPE

primary (aerobic) → aerobic schema

Duration, distance, pace, HR zone

primary (strength_control) → control schema

Sets, hold time, RPE, quality metrics

positional → mobility schema

Holds, hold time, end-range angle, reps (if dynamic)

You can hard-bind these in a simple table:

pattern_id pattern_type intensity_schema
squat primary strength
hinge primary strength
gait primary aerobic
flexion_spine positional mobility
hip_rotation positional mobility

Then in code:

swift
Copy
Edit
let schema = intensitySchemas[pattern.pattern_type]


…instead of 15 pattern-specific if-else checks.

If you want, I can now take your full exercise list and produce a clean mapping to pattern_id, pattern_type, and intensity_schema so it’s ready to drop into your backend. Want me to do that?

You said:

**2\. Contexts (use\_case fixed enum)** ---------------------------------------

okay going back to teh contexts shouldn't there be more things here?
ChatGPT said:

Yes — if we think of context as the role this exercise is playing right now in the plan, assessment and training are just the start.

You probably want a richer set so the same exercise can be clearly flagged when it’s:

being used for baseline testing

acting as a warm-up primer

deployed as a rehab drill

a regression/progression for load management

part of mobility maintenance work

part of performance/skill work

part of cool-down or recovery

Expanded Context Enum (use_case)

Here’s a candidate set that still stays manageable:

assessment – Standardized execution for capturing metrics and scoring.

training – Regular loading/progression work toward performance goals.

rehab_drill – Prescribed for targeted tissue/joint recovery after injury, usually lower load/intensity, high control.

mobility_drill – Dedicated ROM/flexibility work, often positional patterns but could include dynamic drills.

activation – Neural/coordination prep before heavier work (e.g., glute bridge before squats).

warmup – General physiological prep (light aerobic, movement prep, RAMP protocol).

skill_practice – Sport-specific technical work without primary intent of strength or mobility gain.

cooldown – Low-intensity work post-session to promote recovery.

regression – Easier variation for technique reinforcement or load management (can be linked to injury or skill gap).

progression – Harder variation to challenge capacity or complexity (flag for future programming).

Why this is useful

Programming logic: You can filter or recommend exercises based on their role, not just their pattern or phase.

Analytics: You can see how much of a user’s weekly work is assessment, mobility, rehab, etc.

Injury relevance: Rehab drills and regressions can be surfaced automatically after an injury flag.

Phase interplay: A “training” squat in the Resilience phase is different from a “rehab_drill” squat in the Recovery phase — same pattern, different scoring/expectations.

If you want, I can:

Merge this expanded use_case list into your schema.

Show how phase (recovery/resilience/results) and use_case (assessment, rehab_drill, training, etc.) interact to drive suitability scoring.

Do you want me to map that out?

You said:
I think im still confused on the tags vs the context
ChatGPT said:

Yeah — it’s a subtle distinction because in plain English “tag” sounds like “context,” but in your schema they do two very different jobs.

Here’s the clean way to think about it:

1. Context (dynamic, per prescription)

Definition: Describes how and why the exercise is being used this time in the plan.

Scope: Belongs to the plan instance of the exercise, not the library definition.

Mutable: Yes — the same exercise can have a different context each time it’s prescribed.

Purpose: Changes execution rules, intensity schema, scoring, and maybe camera setup.

Example fields:

json
Copy
Edit
{
"exercise_id": "ohs_bodyweight",
"use_case": "assessment",
"phase": "recovery",
"equipment_used": ["bodyweight", "heels_wedge_5cm"],
"modifiers": { "stance": "shoulder_width", "tempo": "3-1-1-0" },
"target_metrics": ["ohsq_knee_valgus_deg","ohsq_depth_percent"]
}

2. Tags/Attributes (static, per exercise definition)

Definition: Describes what the exercise inherently is regardless of when/why it’s used.

Scope: Stored once in the exercise library and applies to every instance.

Mutable: No — only changes if you edit the master exercise definition.

Purpose: Used for filtering, search, recommendations, and default scoring weights.

Example fields:

json
Copy
Edit
{
"exercise_id": "ohs_bodyweight",
"pattern": "squat",
"required_equipment": ["none"],
"supermetric_impact": ["mobility","functional_strength"],
"base_suitability": { "recovery": 0.8, "resilience": 0.7, "results": 0.5 },
"contraindications": ["acute_knee_pain"],
"indications": ["ankle_dorsiflexion_limit","hip_mobility_limit"],
"sport_weight": { "basketball": 0.7, "soccer": 0.8 }
}

Key Difference
Question Context answers Tags/Attributes answer
“What role is this exercise playing today?” use_case, phase, modifiers ❌
“What kind of exercise is this?” ❌ pattern, supermetric_impact, required_equipment, contraindications
“Will this change next time I use it?” Yes No
“Where is it stored?” Workout/plan prescription Exercise library
Why you need both

Context drives execution and scoring at runtime.

Tags/Attributes drive selection, recommendation, and defaults before runtime.

Example:

You select ohs_bodyweight for an assessment → context = {use_case: assessment, phase: recovery, modifiers: none}.

8 weeks later, you select the same ohs_bodyweight for training → context = {use_case: training, phase: resilience, modifiers: loaded}.

The exercise tags (pattern=squat, supermetric=mobility+functional_strength, etc.) never change.

If you want, I can diagram how phase, context, and tags interact in the scoring logic, so it’s easier to see why they’re distinct.

Do you want me to map that out visually?

You said:
so structurally there are patterns, pattern types, context options, tags, exercises, metrics, and super metrics. are there any other concepts missing
ChatGPT said:

You’ve got most of the big building blocks, but based on how you want this system to work long-term, there are a few other concepts that are worth calling out explicitly so you don’t end up shoving them into the wrong bucket later.

Core Structural Concepts (with what you already have)

Patterns – biomechanical categories (e.g., squat, hinge, hip_rotation)

Pattern Types – high-level grouping of patterns for defaults & scoring curves (primary, positional, etc.)

Context (use_case) – dynamic role in the plan (assessment, training, rehab_drill, warmup, etc.)

Tags / Attributes – static metadata for library exercises (pattern, required_equipment, contraindications, etc.)

Exercises – the actual library entries (Overhead Squat, Box Squat to Bench…)

Metrics – atomic measurements captured from an exercise instance (knee_valgus_deg, RPE, hold_time_s)

Supermetrics – higher-order categories you roll metrics up into (joint_rom, muscle_flexibility, mobility, functional_strength, aerobic_capacity)

Additional Concepts to Consider
8. Phases (you already use them but haven’t made them explicit in structure)

Recovery, Resilience, Results.

Each phase has its own suitability weights for exercises.

Should be a first-class entity because it affects scoring, progression rules, and UI.

Ties into context but is distinct — phase is a where in the plan thing, context is a why/how this drill is used thing.

9. Modifiers (dynamic per prescription)

Execution tweaks that don’t change the base exercise definition but change intensity, load, or relevance.

Examples: heels elevated, band-assisted, stance width, ROM limit, grip, tempo.

Important to keep separate from context — they’re how it’s done physically, not why it’s in the plan.

10. Progressions / Regressions

Relationships between exercises that represent load or complexity changes.

Lets the system auto-suggest swaps when the athlete needs easier/harder versions.

Can be stored as a relationship table:

json
Copy
Edit
{ "exercise_id": "box_squat_bench", "progression_of": "goblet_squat_light" }

11. Relationships to Goals & Sports

You already have sport_weight and goal_weight as tags.

Might be worth making “goal” and “sport” a controlled vocabulary instead of ad-hoc keys in a JSON blob so you can filter reliably.

12. Assessment Profiles

Defined set of metrics, setup instructions, and scoring rules tied to an exercise when used in use_case=assessment.

Stored separately from the exercise so you can update protocols without changing the core definition.

13. Equipment Inventory

Controlled list of all possible equipment objects (PVC, DB, band, barbell, wedge, etc.).

This prevents messy free-text in required_equipment and equipment_used.

14. Contraindication / Indication Vocabulary

Similar to equipment — keep a controlled set of possible conditions/limitations so logic & filtering works consistently.

So a clean model has:

Patterns

Pattern Types

Exercises

Tags/Attributes

Context (use_case)

Phases

Modifiers

Metrics

Supermetrics

Goals (vocab)

Sports (vocab)

Assessment Profiles

Equipment (vocab)

Contraindication/Indication vocab

Progression/Regression links

If you want, I can draw the entity-relationship diagram for these so you can see exactly how they fit together and which ones are static vs dynamic. That would make it crystal clear.

Do you want me to do that next?

You said:
if we have goals and sports then we should have injury as well. also the progression/regression seems like a later feature. also why is use_case in parentheses next to context is all of the context just boil down to the use_case
ChatGPT said:

Great call on injury—it needs to be first‑class, not sprinkled into notes. And no, context ≠ use_case. use_case is just one field inside a broader context object that defines how an exercise is used right now.

Here’s the clean cut:

What to include (now vs later)
Core entities (ship now)

Pattern → biomechanical bucket (e.g., squat, hinge).

Pattern Type → maps pattern → intensity schema family (primary, positional; optionally strength_control, aerobic).

Exercise → the library entry (Overhead Squat, Box Squat).

Tags/Attributes (static) → pattern, required_equipment, supermetric_impact, base_suitability, contraindications, indications, sport_weight, goal_weight.

Metrics → atomic measures with target_type & supermetric.

Supermetrics → joint_rom, muscle_flexibility, mobility, functional_strength, aerobic_capacity.

Phases → recovery, resilience, results (affects scoring).

Injury (new) → controlled vocab + stage; drives gates & boosts.

Context (dynamic) → how this exercise is used this time.

Later (don’t block v1)

Progression/Regression graph → relationships between exercises.

Injury as a first‑class concept

Why: You want program logic that’s explicit (e.g., “quad_strain_stage1” reduces allowed knee‑dominant loaded work). Stop faking it with tags.

Model

injury.id (controlled vocab): calf_strain, it_band_pain, shin_splints, hamstring_strain, quad_strain, limited_shoulder_mobility, tight_hips, etc.

injury.stage (enum): acute, subacute, late, resolved.

injury.side: left|right|bilateral.

Rules:

contraindication links: exercise ↔ injury/stage → gate_multiplier (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1).

indication links: exercise ↔ injury/stage → positive priority boost.

This lets you compute:
impact_phase *= gate_multiplier(injury) * (1 + indication_boost(injury)).

Context vs use_case (don’t collapse them)

Context is the whole runtime prescription container.
use_case is just the “why” field inside it.

Why this separation matters:

Same exercise, different roles:

use_case=assessment → lock protocol, capture specific metrics, strict scoring.

use_case=training → load/RPE focus, optional metrics.

use_case=rehab_drill → lower intensity curve, injury gates applied.

Same exercise, different modifiers: wedge, stance, ROM limit → you don’t create new exercises for those.

Controlled vocab you should lock now

Pattern Types → Intensity Schemas

primary → strength (sets, reps, load, tempo, RPE)

primary (gait) → aerobic (duration, distance, pace, HR zone)

primary (brace/rotate) → strength_control (sets, time, RPE, quality)

positional → mobility (holds, hold_time_s, angle_deg, optional load)

Contexts (use_case)
assessment, training, rehab_drill, mobility_drill, activation, warmup, skill_practice, cooldown, regression, progression

Injury vocab (starter)
calf_strain, it_band_pain, shin_splints, quad_strain, hamstring_strain, limited_shoulder_mobility, tight_hips, achilles_tendinopathy, patellofemoral_pain, low_back_pain
Stages: acute, subacute, late, resolved.

Modifiers (common)

Quick sanity checks (so you don’t drift)

If it changes per session, it’s context.

If it describes the exercise in general, it’s a tag/attribute.

If it changes the intensity fields you show, it’s determined by pattern_type (not by context).

If it blocks or boosts based on a condition, model it under injury rules (not ad‑hoc tags).

If you want, I’ll generate:

A controlled vocab JSON for injuries + stages,

A context schema your app can validate against,

And patch your library schema to add indications and the injury gating map.

You said:
what is target_type mean within metrics
ChatGPT said:

In the metric schema we were building earlier, target_type is basically the “what this metric is measuring” category — it tells you the kind of thing the measurement applies to, so you can:

display it in the right UI group,

validate the units,

roll it up into the right supermetric calculations.

Target Type values (starter set)

joint

Measurement is tied to a specific anatomical joint.

Example: hip_flexion_deg in an ASLR test → joint = hip.

Usually expressed in degrees, sometimes as % of normative ROM.

muscle

Measurement is tied to a muscle or muscle group.

Example: hamstring_flexibility_score, quad_strength_kg.

Units could be torque, length, strength scores, etc.

movement

Measurement describes a quality or outcome of a whole movement pattern, not just a single joint/muscle.

Example: trunk_lean_deg in an overhead squat, weight_symmetry_percent in a hinge.

systemic

Measurement applies to the whole body or overall condition.

Example: RPE, pain_score, aerobic_pace, HR_zone.

Why it’s useful

Filtering: You can easily pull “all joint ROM metrics” for a given joint, or “all movement quality metrics” for squats.

Validation: Joint metrics should have deg or %norm units; systemic metrics shouldn’t.

Scoring: Joint/muscle metrics roll into specific supermetrics like joint_rom or muscle_flexibility, while systemic metrics may go to aerobic_capacity or into wellness dashboards.

Example metric entry:

json
Copy
Edit
{
"metric_id": "ohsq_knee_valgus_deg",
"name": "OHSQ Knee Valgus (Frontal)",
"unit": "deg",
"target_type": "joint",
"target_id": "knee",
"supermetric": "mobility",
"rom_mode": "loaded",
"eval_method": "cv"
}


Here:

target_type = joint → we know it belongs in a joint ROM/mobility report.

target_id = knee → ties it to the knee joint in anatomy mapping.

If you want, I can give you a full controlled vocab for target_type and target_id so it’s consistent across your entire metric catalog. That would make your metrics schema bulletproof for scaling.

Do you want me to draft that?

You said:
where do the formulas for impact/phase, sport alignment, contraindication/indication for injury, and intensity live
ChatGPT said:

Short answer: don’t hard‑code any of that in the app. Put all the math and rules in server‑side, versioned policy tables (or JSON configs) that your scoring service reads at runtime. That’s how you A/B, hot‑fix, and audit without shipping a new build.

Here’s the breakdown of what lives where and how to store it.

Where each formula/rule lives

Impact by phase (Recovery/Resilience/Results)
Lives in: phase_policies (server config).
Contains the intensity curves and any pattern_type multipliers.

Sport alignment
Lives in: sport_policies (server config).
Contains per‑sport weights and optional pattern/exercise overrides.

Contraindication / Indication (injury gating & boosts)
Lives in: injury_rules (server config).
Maps (injury_id, stage, exercise_id|pattern) → gate_multiplier and indication_boost.

Intensity mapping (schema → intensity_norm ∈ [0,1])
Lives in: intensity_mappers (server config).
Separate mappers per pattern_type / intensity_schema (strength, mobility, aerobic, strength_control).

Exercise defaults (base suitability)
Lives in: exercises (static library).
Per‑exercise base_suitability vector (recovery/resilience/results).

Client (iOS) should only compute UI‑friendly labels and render; final scoring happens server‑side so you can change policy without an app update.

Sport bias = (exercise.sport_weight[sport] OR policy.pattern_weight[pattern])^alpha

Injury gate = gate_multiplier from best‑match injury_rules

Indication boost = multiply by (1 + boost) if present (cap total ≤ 1 before scaling to 100)

Final = 100 * Base * Curve * SportBias * InjuryGate * (1+Boost)

Audit: return the components and the rule IDs used so coaches can see why something ranked high/low.

Versioning & governance (otherwise this will rot)

Every policy blob (phase_policies, sport_policies, injury_rules, intensity_mappers) has a version string, author, effective_at, changelog.

Score requests include the policy version used; store it with the session so you can reproduce results.

Keep a staging and prod policy set; run A/B by user cohort.

Add unit tests for canonical prescriptions (e.g., “RFESS @ RPE6 in Resilience with no injuries → ~0.85”).

Where NOT to put things

Not in the iOS app (baked constants) — you’ll ship bugs you can’t fix quickly.

Not in the exercise library (e.g., hardcoded intensity curves per exercise) — you’ll duplicate identical logic and never keep it in sync.

Not mixed with contraindications — keep exclusion (gate) separate from priority (indication boost).

Example end‑to‑end: RFESS @ RPE 6 for soccer, subacute hamstring strain

intensity_norm = max(0.6, %1RM) (strength mapper) → 0.6

Phase: resilience → curve(0.6 | primary) ≈ 0.96

Base suitability (exercise): resilience 0.9

Sport bias: exercise.sport_weight.soccer 0.6 with α=0.5 → sqrt(0.6) ≈ 0.775

Injury rule: subacute hamstring strain → lunge_split gate 0.75, indication boost 0.15

Final ≈ 100 * 0.9 * 0.96 * 0.775 * 0.75 * 1.15 ≈ 57.7

Explanation: limited by hamstring gate; still decent for resilience.

If you want, I’ll generate stub JSON files for these four policy sets (phase, sport, injury, intensity) with the exact shapes above and a tiny Node/Python scoring function you can drop into your API today.

You said:
is server side different from my supabase database? do I need different service to be able to run code to compute values and send them back to the iOS client?
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 8s

Short answer: you don’t need a whole new backend—Supabase already gives you everything you need to run server‑side logic. Your iOS app should not compute final scores; do that on the server so you can change policy without shipping an app update.

Here’s the sane architecture:

What “server‑side” means here

Supabase Postgres (SQL/PLpgSQL): you can store policies and even compute scores inside the DB via SQL functions/views.

Supabase Edge Functions (Deno/TypeScript): lightweight serverless endpoints where you can run your scoring code, load policies from Postgres, and return results to iOS.

PostgREST RPC: expose Postgres functions as RPC endpoints if you keep logic in SQL.

You already have a “server” because Supabase is your backend. You just decide where the scoring runs: inside Postgres or in an Edge Function.

Three viable setups (pick one)
1) All‑in‑DB (SQL function) — simplest wiring

Store your phase_policies, sport_policies, injury_rules, intensity_mappers in tables.

Write a SQL/PLpgSQL function score_prescription(user_id, exercise_id, context_json) that:

Normalizes intensity from the context,

Applies the phase curve for the exercise’s pattern_type,

Applies sport bias and injury gates,

Returns {recovery, resilience, results, components}.

Expose it as an RPC endpoint. Use SECURITY DEFINER + RLS so users only touch their rows.

Pros: minimal infra, low latency, one deployment surface.

Cons: math/curves are a bit clunky to maintain in SQL, testing is rougher.

2) Edge Function (TypeScript) — best flexibility (my recommendation)

Keep policies in Postgres tables (versioned).

Create an Edge Function score-prescription that:

Pulls policies by version,

Runs the exact scoring pipeline,

Returns scores + an explanation payload.

iOS calls this function; the function reads with the service role (not exposed to the client), so you can safely combine user data + policies.

Pros: easy unit tests, readable math, quick policy tweaks, clearer error handling.

Cons: slight cold‑start penalty (usually small).

3) Hybrid

Do intensity normalization and simple joins in SQL,

Do curves, gates, and composition in an Edge Function.

Pros: you keep heavy joins in Postgres, custom math in code.

Do you need another “service”?

No. Use Supabase Edge Functions for code, Postgres for storage & access control. That’s your whole backend.

What should not live on the iOS client

Policy logic and final scoring. If you bake curves/gates into the app, you’ll ship bugs you can’t patch quickly and you invite tampering. The client can show labels (“moderate intensity”, “best for resilience”) and render explanations it gets from the server.

Concrete plan to implement (no fluff)

Tables (server)

exercises (static library, you already have this)

patterns (with pattern_type, intensity_schema)

phase_policies, sport_policies, injury_rules, intensity_mappers (versioned JSON or normalized tables)

Edge Function: score-prescription

Input: { user_id, exercise_id, context }

Reads: exercise + pattern → pattern_type; policy sets by active_version

Computes: intensity_norm → phase curve → sport bias → injury gate/boost

Returns: { recovery, resilience, results, components: { base, curve, sportBias, injuryGate, boost, version } }

iOS

Builds the context (use_case, phase, equipment_used, modifiers, intensity fields).

Calls score-prescription.

Renders scores & explanation; never reimplements the math.

Security

Enable RLS on any per‑user tables.

Edge function uses service role to read policy tables; it can still respect RLS when fetching user data by user_id.

Never expose the service key to iOS.

When to keep logic in Postgres instead

If you want RPC only and you’re comfortable in SQL.

If you need deterministic results entirely in the DB for audit (e.g., materialized views, generated columns).

Pitfalls (don’t do these)

Don’t compute final scores on device “for speed.” You’ll regret the maintenance.

Don’t hard‑code curves/gates into the exercise library rows; they belong in policy tables.

Don’t mix injury gating with indication boosts in the same field. Keep them separate with clear precedence.

If you want, I’ll give you:

A minimal DDL for policy tables,

A TypeScript skeleton for the score-prescription Edge Function,

And a tiny Swift client call showing how iOS posts context and receives scores.

3. Evaluating Existing DB Schema

Checklist:

Does exercises have a clean FK to patterns?

Do you already store pattern_type? If not, can you infer it?

Are tags stored as JSON? Are they normalized enough for search?

Are injuries modeled as entities, or just text in contraindications?

Are supermetrics linked to metrics, or are they hardcoded per exercise?

Are phase curves, sport weights, and injury rules hardcoded? If yes → move to policy tables.

4. SQL Queries (Examples)

Get all exercises suited for recovery phase with current injury gates:

sql
Copy
Edit
select e.id, e.name, e.base_suitability->>'recovery' as base_score,
ir.gate_multiplier, ir.indication_boost
from exercises e
join patterns p on e.pattern_id = p.id
join pattern_types pt on p.pattern_type_id = pt.id
left join injury_rules ir on ir.pattern_id = p.id
where ir.injury_id = 'UUID_OF_INJURY'
and ir.stage = 'subacute';


Get phase curve for an exercise:

sql
Copy
Edit
select pp.curve
from exercises e
join patterns p on e.pattern_id = p.id
join phase_policies pp on pp.pattern_type_id = p.pattern_type_id
where e.id = 'EXERCISE_UUID'
and pp.phase_id = 'PHASE_UUID';

Durability AI Full System Blueprint and Seed Data Package

Durability AI System Blueprint
Core Entities and Schema

This section describes the schema for all core entities in the Durability AI system. Each entity is represented as a table in the database, with key fields and relationships outlined below.

Pattern Types

Definition: Categories that classify patterns by training modality or focus (e.g., Strength vs Endurance).

id (PK): Unique identifier for the pattern type (integer primary key).

name: Text name of the pattern type (e.g., "Strength", "Endurance"). Not null.

description: Text description of this category.

Example: Pattern types might include Strength, Endurance, Mobility, Stability, etc., to label the nature of patterns and exercises.

Patterns

Definition: Fundamental movement or training patterns. Each pattern belongs to a pattern type.

id (PK): Unique identifier for the pattern.

name: Name of the movement pattern (e.g., "Squat", "Hinge", "Vertical Pull"). Not null.

pattern_type_id (FK): Reference to the Pattern Types table, indicating the category of this pattern.

description: Text description of the pattern.

Each pattern corresponds to a fundamental movement or exercise category (for example, Squat, Hinge, Lunge, Push, Pull, Carry, etc.). The pattern_type_id associates it with a modality like Strength or Stability. For instance, "Squat" may be categorized under the Strength pattern type.

Exercises

Definition: Specific exercises or movements. Each exercise is linked to a pattern.

id (PK): Unique identifier for the exercise.

name: Name of the exercise (e.g., "Barbell Back Squat", "Plank"). Not null.

pattern_id (FK): Reference to the Patterns table (the movement pattern this exercise exemplifies).

description: Text description of the exercise (what it is and how it is performed).

level: Difficulty or proficiency level (e.g., Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced).

Exercises are the concrete activities performed by users. They inherit classification from their associated pattern (and pattern type). The level field provides a general indication of difficulty or progression stage. Instead of a fixed field for level, difficulty can also be represented via tags (see Tags/Attributes below), which provides more flexibility. Each exercise can be associated with multiple tags for richer classification.

Tags / Attributes

Definition: Flexible labels to tag exercises (or patterns) with additional attributes such as required equipment, target muscle group, difficulty, etc.

id (PK): Unique identifier for the tag/attribute.

name: Text of the tag (e.g., "Bodyweight", "Barbell", "Cardio", "Beginner"). Not null.

category: Category of the tag to group similar attributes (e.g., Equipment, Difficulty, Modality, BodyPart).

Tags allow filtering and extended metadata. For example, an exercise may have tags for equipment (Bodyweight, Dumbbell, Machine), difficulty level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced), or other attributes like Cardio, Strength, Mobility, Balance. Tags are linked to exercises through an association table (many-to-many relationship), since an exercise can have multiple tags.



Note: In the database, a join table exercise_tags is used to associate exercises with tags. It contains exercise_id and tag_id pairs for each assignment. This allows queries like "find all Beginner exercises requiring no equipment."

Metrics

Definition: Atomic performance metrics that can be recorded or used to quantify exercises.

id (PK): Unique identifier for the metric.

name: Name of the metric (e.g., "Weight", "Repetitions", "Duration"). Not null.

unit: Unit of measurement (e.g., "kg", "count", "seconds", "bpm").

description: Description of the metric's meaning or usage.

Metrics represent raw data points (inputs or outputs) for exercise performance. For instance, a Strength exercise might use Weight (kg) and Repetitions, while an Endurance exercise might use Duration or Heart Rate. These metrics feed into calculations for intensity and scoring.

Supermetrics

Definition: Composite or aggregated metrics, often derived from basic metrics, to track higher-level performance or scoring.

id (PK): Unique identifier for the supermetric.

name: Name of the supermetric (e.g., "Total Volume", "Durability Score").

description: Explanation of what the supermetric represents or how it's calculated.

Supermetrics combine multiple data points or metrics. For example, Total Volume could be computed as Weight * Reps summed across sets (a measure of work done in a strength exercise). A Durability Score might aggregate strength, stability, and mobility metrics to give an overall indicator of durability. These computations are defined in code or derived via queries rather than being directly stored (though they could be materialized for performance).

Phases

Definition: Training phases or program stages that an exercise or pattern might be associated with.

id (PK): Unique identifier for the phase.

name: Name of the phase (e.g., "Phase 1 - Recovery", "Phase 3 - Strength").

description: Description of the training phase's focus.

Phases can be used to periodize or categorize programs (for example, Recovery, Foundation, Strength, Performance phases). In practice, one might tag certain exercises or patterns as appropriate for certain phases (e.g., basic mobility drills in Phase 1, heavy lifts in Phase 3). While this blueprint doesn't create an explicit link table between exercises and phases, such relationships can be added (e.g., a table linking exercises to phases if needed for program generation).

Injuries

Definition: Injuries or conditions that need to be considered when recommending exercises (for contraindications or rehabilitation).

id (PK): Unique identifier for the injury/condition.

name: Name of the injury or condition (e.g., "Knee Pain", "Shoulder Impingement"). Not null.

description: Description of the injury, context, or severity notes.

This table enumerates common injuries or physical conditions that affect exercise selection. The injury data is used to filter out contraindicated exercises and suggest indicated ones (rehabilitative or supportive exercises).



Exercise Contraindications / Indications: There are two association tables to map relationships between Exercises and Injuries:

exercise_contraindications: Lists pairs of (exercise_id, injury_id) where performing that exercise could aggravate the injury (i.e., the exercise is contraindicated for that injury).

exercise_indications: Lists pairs of (exercise_id, injury_id) where the exercise is beneficial or recommended for the injury (i.e., an indicated rehab or prehab exercise).

These mappings are used in logic to exclude harmful exercises and include helpful ones based on a user's injury profile.

Context

Definition: Contextual scenarios or conditions under which a program is generated. Context influences exercise selection and parameters.

id (PK): Unique identifier for the context.

name: Name of the context scenario (e.g., "Home / No Equipment", "Rehab / Low Intensity"). Not null.

description: Details about the context (equipment availability, time constraints, goals).

equipment_available: Boolean indicating if substantial equipment is available (TRUE for full gym equipment, FALSE for bodyweight/minimal equipment scenarios).

intensity_level: Desired intensity level for the session (e.g., "Low", "Medium", "High").

time_limit: Time constraint in minutes (if applicable; e.g., 15 for a quick workout, or NULL for none).

Contexts encapsulate external factors and user goals. For example, a Home / No Equipment context will restrict exercises to those with no equipment requirement, and likely moderate intensity. A Rehab context implies low intensity and a focus on safe movements. Context definitions can be used by filtering logic to tailor exercise selection (see filtering pseudocode below). In the database, context can be a standalone table; if more complex rules are needed, context can also be linked to specific tag requirements (e.g., context "No Equipment" could be associated with a rule that equipment tags must be "Bodyweight").

Scoring and Intensity Normalization

To compare effort across different types of exercises, Durability AI uses intensity normalization policies. These policies define how raw metrics translate into a unified intensity score or category. Each pattern type can have its own scoring logic. Below is a summary of how intensity is handled for each major category (pattern type):

Pattern Type Primary Metrics Normalization Policy
Strength Weight, Reps (and optionally 1RM) Intensity is calculated relative to the individual's capacity. For example, weight can be expressed as a percentage of one-rep max. A heavy set (near 100% of 1RM for few reps) would yield a high intensity score (close to 100). More reps at lower weight produce a moderate intensity. RPE (Rate of Perceived Exertion) can also be used to fine-tune the score. A policy table or formula (e.g., using the Epley formula or an RPE conversion chart) can map weight and reps to a normalized 0–10 or 0–100 intensity value.
Endurance Heart Rate, Pace, Duration Intensity is based on cardiovascular effort. For example, heart rate as a percentage of max heart rate or pace as a fraction of personal best. Running or cycling at max sustainable speed would be high intensity. The normalization might map heart rate zones to intensity scores (e.g., Zone 2 = low, Zone 5 = very high).
Mobility Range of motion, Discomfort level Intensity for mobility exercises is qualitative. A possible approach is to score intensity by the difficulty or discomfort of the stretch. If a stretch is taken to near-end range (significant effort or discomfort), label it as higher intensity. Otherwise gentle mobility work scores low. This may be simplified to categorical values (e.g., light, moderate stretch) since quantitative metrics are harder.
Stability Hold time, Stability challenge Intensity for stability/balance exercises might be derived from how challenging the position or movement is and how long it can be held. For instance, a basic plank might be medium intensity if held to fatigue, whereas an advanced balance exercise on an unstable surface could rate high. Normalization might use time (longer hold = higher endurance but possibly lower intensity per second) combined with a difficulty factor. Often a simple Low/Medium/High classification is used for stability challenges.

The system may use lookup tables or formulas to implement these policies. For example, a Strength Policy table could define intensity multipliers for rep counts at a given %1RM, ensuring consistent scoring. Similarly, a Heart Rate Zone table could map beats-per-minute ranges to a 1–10 intensity scale. All exercises then get an intensity score which can be used to balance workouts or ensure a target intensity range is met.



Normalization Example: If a user performs a squat with 80 kg for 5 reps and their estimated 1RM is 100 kg, that's 80% of 1RM for 5 reps, which might correspond to ~8/10 intensity (vigorous but not maximal). A 30-minute jog at 60% max heart rate might be considered ~5/10 intensity (moderate). These scores allow the system to compare or limit workloads across exercise types.

Versioning and Deployment Guidance

Maintaining the system blueprint requires careful versioning as the schema and data evolve:

Schema Versioning: Assign a version number to the database schema (and possibly seed data). For example, use semantic versioning (v1.0, v1.1, etc.) whenever you add or modify tables and fields. Keep a changelog in the documentation or in the repository (e.g., a CHANGELOG.md that notes new columns or entities).

Migrations: Use Supabase CLI or a migration tool to apply schema changes. Each change (adding a table, altering a column) should be done via a SQL migration script. This ensures reproducibility. For instance, use supabase migration create "add-new-entity" to generate a migration file, then fill in the CREATE TABLE or ALTER TABLE statements.

Seed Data Versioning: Treat the seed data as part of the version. If core seed data (like a new pattern or exercise) is added or changed, update the seed files and bump a minor version. Provide a clear path for deploying these changes (for example, a fresh seed insert or an UPSERT logic).

Deployment Workflow: In a team setting, maintain the schema in source control (SQL files or a declarative format). On deployment, apply migrations in order, then load or sync seed data. Supabase CLI can run supabase db push to apply schema to the linked database. Alternatively, use pgdump for a baseline schema and separate seed import scripts for data.

Backward Compatibility: If releasing a new version of the schema, consider writing migrations to transform existing production data to fit the new schema (for example, populating a new column with default values or splitting a field).

Testing Upgrades: Try the migration on a staging database with a copy of data to ensure it doesn't break existing queries or logic. Only then apply to production.

By following versioning best practices, the Durability AI data model can be safely updated over time without disrupting service or losing data.

Security and RLS Guidance (Supabase)

Security is critical since Durability AI stores user-specific data (e.g., personal workout info, possibly health info). Supabase uses PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS) to enforce access control. Key guidelines:

Enable RLS on all tables containing user data: Supabase recommends enabling RLS on any table in the exposed schema (typically public)
supabase.com
. When RLS is enabled, by default no rows are returned unless policies permit it.

Default to least privilege: After enabling RLS, define explicit policies for each table:

For reference tables that are non-sensitive (like Patterns, Exercises, Tags), you can allow read access to all users while restricting writes. For example, allow SELECT for role authenticated (and anon if you want even non-logged-in users to read) with condition TRUE (no restriction), but no INSERT/UPDATE except for admins or service role.

For user-specific tables (e.g., if there was a user_progress table or personal notes), create policies tying records to auth.uid(). For instance, a policy to allow users to see only their own records would use something like: CREATE POLICY ... USING ((SELECT auth.uid()) = user_id)
supabase.com
.

Use Supabase Auth roles: Supabase provides an authenticated role for logged-in users and anon for others. Use the TO authenticated or TO anon clause in policies to differentiate open access from restricted. For example, you might allow authenticated users to SELECT from the Exercises table but no one to modify it, and no access at all for anon if your API should only serve logged-in users.

Service Role for privileged actions: In Supabase, the service key (used on the backend) can bypass RLS. Design your backend functions or admin interface to use the service role when seeding or modifying core data. Regular clients (using JWT auth) should operate under RLS restrictions.

Row Level Security Policies: Write policies for each table according to use case:

Core lookup tables (Patterns, Exercises, etc.): Enable RLS, then allow full read (SELECT) to all authenticated users
supabase.com
. Disallow INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE for regular users; only allow these via service role or a role check (e.g., if you had an is_admin claim).

User-specific tables (if any): E.g., a hypothetical user_workout_log table would have ENABLE RLS and a policy USING (user_id = auth.uid()) to ensure each user only sees their rows. You would also add a WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid()) on INSERT/UPDATE to prevent one user spoofing another's ID.

Verify policy effects: Remember that once RLS is enabled on a table, any query with the anon (public) role will return nothing unless a policy allows it
supabase.com
. Always test as an unauthenticated and as an authenticated user to make sure the policies are correctly restricting access.

Encryption & sensitive data: If any personal health data or identifiable information is stored, consider using additional encryption (Supabase offers extensions like pgcrypto). Also, apply the principle of minimum data retrieval – queries should only select the necessary fields (which is more of an application concern, but worth noting).

Monitoring and Logging: Use Supabase's logging to monitor if any policy rejections occur (for example, if a client tries to access something they shouldn't, the 403 errors can be logged). This can help fine-tune policies.

In summary, enable RLS on all tables in the public schema and create strict policies
supabase.com
supabase.com
. The combination of RLS and Supabase Auth ensures that each user or role only accesses allowed data. This provides end-to-end security from the database level upward.

Testing and Validation Procedures

Ensuring that the blueprint is correctly implemented requires tests at multiple levels:

Schema Validation: Verify that all foreign key relationships are intact and working. For example, inserting an Exercise with a non-existent pattern_id should fail. Ensure that NOT NULL constraints are present where expected (names, required fields). One can write basic tests or use a tool (like Postgres' pgTAP extension) to assert schema properties.

Seed Data Checks: After loading seed data (the CSV/JSON files provided), run sanity queries. For instance:

Count that each patterns' pattern_type_id actually exists in Pattern Types.

Pick a sample exercise and join through pattern to pattern_type to confirm the relationships.

Ensure no duplicate tags or other unique fields.

Business Logic Tests: Use the pseudocode logic on known scenarios to see if results match expectations:

Intensity Calculation: Take a known exercise scenario (like a weight and rep for strength, or a duration for cardio) and compute intensity. Check that it falls in the expected range or category. For example, if a user performs a very easy set, verify the intensity comes out low.

Filtering by Context/Tags: Simulate a context and verify filtering. For a "Home / No Equipment" context, ensure that none of the exercises selected require equipment (i.e., all have the "Bodyweight" tag or similar). If the context has intensity_level = Low, ensure high-intensity exercises (like very heavy lifts) are filtered out or at least flagged.

Contraindication Logic: Create a test user profile with an injury (e.g., Knee Pain) and a context, run the exercise selection routine, and confirm that no contraindicated exercises for Knee Pain are present. Additionally, verify that indicated exercises for Knee Pain are included or prioritized. For example, if "Knee Pain" is active, ensure squats or lunges above a certain intensity are removed, but rehab moves like TKE or Clamshell are present.

Unit Testing Functions: If you implement the intensity calculation or filtering as database functions or in application code, write unit tests for those functions. For instance, a test for calculate_intensity(strengthExerciseInput) should assert known outputs for given inputs (maybe using fixed 1RM assumptions).

Integration Testing: Use a staging environment of the Supabase DB with the schema and run end-to-end scenarios:

Insert a fake user and assign them a context and an injury.

Run the stored procedure or API that generates a workout prescription.

Check that the returned exercises respect all rules (context filters, no contraindications, correct intensities).

Also ensure RLS policies don't inadvertently block the procedure or the data retrieval for that user.

RLS Policy Testing: As mentioned, test with different roles. In Supabase, you can use the JWT of a test user to simulate authenticated requests and also call the API with no JWT for anon. Verify:

Authenticated user can read the reference tables (Patterns, Exercises).

Authenticated user cannot write to them (try an insert via the API, expect rejection).

Authenticated user can insert and read their own user-specific records (if such tables exist).

Anonymous cannot read data that should require auth.

The service role (using the secret key) can perform admin operations (like seeding or bulk updates).

Performance Validation: Though not strictly asked, it's wise to ensure that the filtering logic and intensity calculations perform under load. For instance, if the recommendation query joins many tables (exercises, tags, injuries), ensure indexes are in place (e.g., on exercise_tags(exercise_id) and exercise_tags(tag_id), etc.). Write tests or use EXPLAIN plans to confirm that queries use indexes.

By following these testing steps, you validate that the system blueprint works as intended and can be confidently deployed. Testing should be part of the development cycle whenever the schema or logic is updated (for example, re-run these tests after any version upgrade as mentioned in Versioning).

Pseudocode for Key Logic

To implement the core logic of Durability AI, we outline pseudocode for the primary decision-making components: intensity calculation, context/tag filtering, and contraindication checks. This pseudocode can be used to guide actual code or database function implementations.

Intensity Calculation by Pattern Type

This function computes a normalized intensity value for a given exercise attempt, based on the exercise's pattern type and relevant metrics.

pseudo
Copy
Edit
function calculate_intensity(exercise, metrics):
# Determine pattern type of the exercise (e.g., Strength, Endurance, etc.)
type = exercise.pattern.pattern_type.name

if type == "Strength":
# Assume metrics include weight (kg) and reps
weight = metrics["weight"] # weight used in kg
reps = metrics["reps"] # repetitions performed
# If 1RM (one-rep max) known (could be precomputed or stored per user):
if metrics.contains("one_rm"):
one_rm = metrics["one_rm"]
else:
# Estimate 1RM from weight and reps (e.g., Epley formula)
one_rm = weight * (1 + reps / 30.0)
intensity_percent = (weight / one_rm) * 100 # percentage of max
# Adjust by reps: if doing high reps at lower %1RM, intensity might still be moderate
# For simplicity, you might take intensity_percent as is, or use a table.
intensity = intensity_percent # output on 0-100 scale
if intensity > 100: intensity = 100 # cap at 100%

elseif type == "Endurance":
# Use heart rate or pace to determine intensity
hr = metrics.get("heart_rate") # current heart rate
max_hr = metrics.get("max_heart_rate") # user max heart rate
if hr and max_hr:
intensity = (hr / max_hr) * 100 # percentage of max HR
else:
# Alternatively, use perceived exertion or pace
rpe = metrics.get("RPE") # 1-10 scale
if rpe:
intensity = (rpe / 10.0) * 100 # convert RPE to %
else:
intensity = 0 # default if no data
# Cap and categorize if needed
if intensity > 100: intensity = 100

elseif type == "Mobility":
# Mobility intensity might use subjective measures
discomfort = metrics.get("discomfort_level") # e.g., 1-10
if discomfort:
intensity = (discomfort / 10.0) * 100
else:
# If stretch was easy and full range, call it low intensity
intensity = 20 # default low intensity
# Mobility generally kept low/moderate to avoid injury

elseif type == "Stability":
# Stability intensity could be based on how challenging the variation is
difficulty = metrics.get("difficulty") # e.g., a score or level of the exercise variation
hold_time = metrics.get("hold_time") # how long (seconds) held, if relevant
if difficulty:
intensity = difficulty * 20 # assuming difficulty is 1-5 scale, convert to % (this is arbitrary)
else:
intensity = 0
# Optionally adjust intensity by hold time (longer hold might increase endurance demand but not peak intensity)
# For simplicity, ignore hold_time or use it to slightly adjust intensity.

else:
# Unknown type, default
intensity = metrics.get("RPE", 50) # use RPE if available, else 50 as medium

# Final normalization
if intensity < 0: intensity = 0
if intensity > 100: intensity = 100
return intensity # as a percentage (0-100) or could convert to 0-10 scale if needed


Explanation: This pseudocode distinguishes intensity calculation by pattern type. Strength uses weight and reps (and ideally an estimated 1RM) to gauge intensity. Endurance uses heart rate or an RPE if HR is not available. Mobility and Stability rely on more qualitative metrics since they're harder to quantify (we used placeholders like discomfort_level or a difficulty rating). In practice, these would be refined with real data or expert input. The function returns a normalized percentage that can be used consistently across exercise types.

Filtering Logic by Context/Tags

This function filters a list of candidate exercises based on a given context and optional required tags. It ensures that the returned exercises fit the scenario.

pseudo
Copy
Edit
function filter_exercises(exercises, context, required_tags=[]):
filtered = []

for exercise in exercises:
# Check equipment availability
if context.equipment_available == false:
# Context has no equipment: exclude exercises needing equipment
if exercise has any tag in ["Barbell", "Dumbbell", "Machine", "Kettlebell"]:
continue # skip this exercise (requires equipment not available)
# If context allows equipment, we don't filter by equipment tags (all good).

# Check intensity level filtering
if context.intensity_level:
# For simplicity, define a mapping of intensity_level to threshold
level = context.intensity_level # e.g., "Low", "Medium", "High"
exercise_intensity = estimate_exercise_intensity(exercise) # could use pattern type defaults or metadata
if level == "Low" and exercise_intensity > 33:
continue # skip exercises too intense for a low-intensity session
if level == "Medium" and exercise_intensity > 66:
continue # skip very intense exercises in a moderate session
# (If level == "High", we generally allow all, or could ensure some minimum intensity)

# Check required tags
allow = true
for tag in required_tags:
if not exercise has tag:
allow = false
break
if not allow:
continue # this exercise doesn't have a tag that the context or user specifically requires

# If we reach here, exercise passed all filters
filtered.append(exercise)

return filtered


Explanation: The filtering logic goes through each exercise and applies rules:

Equipment: If the context indicates no equipment, any exercise tagged with equipment (barbell, machine, etc.) is excluded.

Intensity: We compare the context's desired intensity level with an estimated intensity of the exercise. If the exercise is inherently too intense for a low or medium session, it's skipped. (For example, heavy deadlifts might be filtered out of a "Low" intensity context).

Required Tags: If the user or context specifically needs certain attributes (like an exercise that targets "Mobility" or a certain muscle group), we ensure each exercise has those tags. Only exercises containing all required tags are kept.

The estimate_exercise_intensity(exercise) in pseudocode stands in for a function that could use exercise metadata (perhaps the pattern type or known difficulty) to judge how intense that exercise typically is. In implementation, we might store a default intensity or difficulty rating with each exercise to aid this filter (e.g., Sprinting is high, Walking is low).



The result is a list of exercises that fit the context's constraints. This would be used as a pool to then apply the injury contraindication filter.

Contraindication/Indication Logic Based on Injury

This logic takes a user's injury profile into account when finalizing exercise selection. It removes contraindicated exercises and can optionally boost or include indicated ones.

pseudo
Copy
Edit
function apply_injury_filters(exercises, user_injuries):
safe_exercises = []

for exercise in exercises:
# Assume user_injuries is a list of injury IDs (or injury objects).
contraindicated = false

for inj in user_injuries:
# Check if this exercise is contraindicated for this injury
if (exercise.id, inj.id) is in exercise_contraindications_table:
contraindicated = true
break
if contraindicated:
continue # skip this exercise entirely

# At this point, exercise is not contraindicated for any user injury.
# (Optional) Check if it's indicated for any injury:
exercise_score = 0
for inj in user_injuries:
if (exercise.id, inj.id) is in exercise_indications_table:
# If it's a specifically recommended exercise for the injury, mark it.
exercise_score += 1 # simple way to prioritize indicated exercises
exercise.indication_score = exercise_score

safe_exercises.append(exercise)

# After filtering, you might sort or prioritize indicated exercises
safe_exercises.sort(by="indication_score", descending=true)

return safe_exercises


Explanation: This function iterates over the candidate exercises (already filtered by context perhaps) and excludes any that appear in the exercise_contraindications mapping for any of the user's injuries. Those that pass are considered "safe." We then optionally check against exercise_indications; if an exercise is known to be beneficial for a condition the user has, we can mark or score it. In this pseudocode, we give it a simple indication_score (e.g., 1 point per relevant injury). Finally, one could sort exercises so that indicated ones are ranked higher or ensure at least one indicated exercise is included in a prescription.



In practice, this could be done in a database query (joining exercises with the injury tables and filtering), or in application logic after querying a list of possible exercises. The outcome is that a user with injuries will not get harmful exercises and is more likely to get helpful ones. For example, a user with "Knee Pain" might have heavy squats and running filtered out, while clamshells and TKEs (Terminal Knee Extensions) are flagged as good and thus chosen.

SQL Schema Definitions

Below are the SQL CREATE TABLE statements for each core entity and the relevant association tables, followed by some sample INSERT statements using the seed data. These definitions align with the schema described above.

sql
Copy
Edit
-- Pattern Types table
CREATE TABLE pattern_types (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
description TEXT
);

-- Patterns table (with FK to Pattern Types)
CREATE TABLE patterns (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT NOT NULL,
pattern_type_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES pattern_types(id),
description TEXT
);

-- Exercises table (with FK to Patterns)
CREATE TABLE exercises (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT NOT NULL,
pattern_id INT NOT NULL REFERENCES patterns(id),
description TEXT,
level TEXT
-- 'level' could alternatively be normalized into tags or a separate table
);

-- Tags table
CREATE TABLE tags (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
category TEXT
);

-- Contexts table
CREATE TABLE contexts (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT NOT NULL,
description TEXT,
equipment_available BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT FALSE,
intensity_level TEXT,
time_limit INT
);

-- Metrics table
CREATE TABLE metrics (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
unit TEXT,
description TEXT
);

-- Supermetrics table
CREATE TABLE supermetrics (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
description TEXT
);

-- Phases table
CREATE TABLE phases (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
description TEXT
);

-- Injuries table
CREATE TABLE injuries (
id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
description TEXT
);

-- Association table for Exercise-Tag (many-to-many)
CREATE TABLE exercise_tags (
exercise_id INT REFERENCES exercises(id),
tag_id INT REFERENCES tags(id),
PRIMARY KEY (exercise_id, tag_id)
);

-- Association table for contraindications (Exercise-Injury)
CREATE TABLE exercise_contraindications (
exercise_id INT REFERENCES exercises(id),
injury_id INT REFERENCES injuries(id),
PRIMARY KEY (exercise_id, injury_id)
);

-- Association table for indications (Exercise-Injury)
CREATE TABLE exercise_indications (
exercise_id INT REFERENCES exercises(id),
injury_id INT REFERENCES injuries(id),
PRIMARY KEY (exercise_id, injury_id)
);


The SQL above defines primary keys, foreign keys, and basic constraints (like some NOT NULL and UNIQUE where appropriate). In a real setup, you might add additional constraints (for example, ensure intensity_level in contexts is one of a set of allowed values, via a CHECK constraint or use of an enum type).



Sample Inserts: Below are a few examples of inserting seed data into these tables. (The full seed data is provided in the accompanying CSV/JSON files.)

INSERT INTO pattern_types (name, description) VALUES
('Strength', 'Strength-focused patterns (resistance training)'),
('Endurance', 'Endurance-focused patterns (cardio, conditioning)'),
('Mobility', 'Mobility-focused patterns (flexibility, range of motion)'),
('Stability', 'Stability-focused patterns (balance, core stability)');

-- Insert a couple of patterns
INSERT INTO patterns (name, pattern_type_id, description) VALUES
('Squat', 1, 'Knee-dominant lower body movement'),
('Vertical Pull', 1, 'Upper body vertical pulling movement (e.g., pull-ups)'),
('Rotation', 4, 'Core rotational movement pattern');

-- Insert example exercises
INSERT INTO exercises (name, pattern_id, description, level) VALUES
('Barbell Back Squat', 1, 'Barbell squat with weight on back', 'Advanced'),
('Pull-Up', 2, 'Bodyweight pull-up exercise', 'Advanced'),
('Russian Twist', 3, 'Seated core rotation exercise (Russian Twist)', 'Beginner');

-- Insert tags and exercise-tag relations
INSERT INTO tags (name, category) VALUES
('Bodyweight', 'Equipment'),
('Barbell', 'Equipment'),
('Beginner', 'Difficulty');
-- Link an exercise to tags (e.g., mark Pull-Up as Bodyweight and Advanced)
INSERT INTO exercise_tags (exercise_id, tag_id) VALUES
(2, 1), -- Pull-Up is a Bodyweight exercise
(1, 2); -- Barbell Back Squat uses Barbell

-- Insert injuries and contraindication mappings
INSERT INTO injuries (name, description) VALUES
('Knee Pain', 'Generic knee pain condition'),
('Shoulder Impingement', 'Shoulder impingement injury');
-- Map a contraindication: Barbell Back Squat (id=1) is contraindicated for Knee Pain (id=1)
INSERT INTO exercise_contraindications (exercise_id, injury_id) VALUES (1, 1);


These SQL statements illustrate how the schema is implemented and how seed data populates the tables. In a production setup, you would likely execute a series of such insert statements (or use a bulk import for large datasets) to seed the database with all patterns, exercises, tags, etc., from the CSV/JSON files.

You said:
how can I get the full chat history for a specific chat
ChatGPT said:

In ChatGPT’s current interface there’s no “export one conversation” button, but you can still get the full history for a specific chat in a few ways:

1. Scroll & Select → Copy → Paste into a file

Open the conversation in ChatGPT.

Scroll to the very top so all messages load.

Select the entire chat from start to end.

Copy and paste into a Markdown or text editor.

Save it as .md or .txt.

This is the most reliable way to keep formatting, since the model can’t fetch old messages from before the current context.

2. Use the “Export Data” feature

Go to Settings → General → Export Data.

This downloads all your conversations as a JSON file.

You can open the JSON and search for the conversation by title or timestamp.

From there, extract that conversation’s content and save it in Markdown or any format you like.

3. Browser-based copy
If you’re on desktop, you can use a browser extension or developer tools to copy the DOM text from the conversation. This sometimes preserves code blocks better than a manual select/copy.

If you want, I can give you a small script that takes the JSON from method #2 and extracts a single conversation into a clean Markdown file — that way you’ll have exactly what you want without manually scrolling.

Do you want me to prepare that extraction script?

ChatGPT can make mistakes. Check important info.
